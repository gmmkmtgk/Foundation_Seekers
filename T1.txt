the countess remond selden entering from the dining room saw that the lounge was crowded and he paused for a moment to look about him it was the half hour between dinner and the sporting club and he was pleasantly aware of the odours of good coffee and super excellent tobacco mingled with the delicate and very expensive perfumes rising from the clothes the hair the shoulders of the women lying indolently back in the deep chairs it was the women who dominated the scene there were men present to be sure but they were as unobtrusive to the eye as strictly utilitarian as the donor kneeling humbly in the corner of the picture before the madonna he had paid to have painted these men were donors too of many things besides paint but the resemblance ended there for there was nothing madonna like about the women they differed in being blonde or brune of various contours and of all ages but some subtle quality of spirit bound them together in a common sisterhood their gowns ran the gamut of the rainbow and were of every material and degree of eccentricity but a common purpose underlay them all every neck bore its rope of pearls every hand its clustered diamonds tributes to beauty one might suppose but not at all the treasures of the rue de la paix the choicest creations of cartier had been showered upon beauty and ugliness alike if there was any difference beauty had the worst of it indeed most of these women were anything but beautiful there were some who were still slim who still had youth and a certain charm there were two or three of an incredible seductiveness more dazzling than the brilliants on their fingers but for the most part they were fat raddled unspeakably vulgar gazing out at the world from between darkened lashes with eyes unutterably weary and disillusioned they were not all courtesans the trophies so lavishly displayed were in part at least the spoils of marriage but virtuous or vicious their worlds moved in the same orbit with the same purpose toward the same end was it one of these women selden wondered who had summoned him to a rendezvous he told himself that he was foolish to have come that he should have known better and he had an impulse to pass on without stopping yet something about the note which had been handed in to him as he was dressing for dinner had piqued his curiosity and piqued it still if mr selden will be in the lounge at 9 45 this evening he will not only give one of his debtors an opportunity to express her gratitude but will learn something that may prove of interest the writing was unusually firm and characteristic he was quite sure that he had never seen it before and it was not in the least sentimental but decidedly of the world it was this which persuaded him to come it is pleasant to have one s services acknowledged and he was always willing to be interested more than once he had been started on a profitable trail in some such unusual fashion on the other hand should it prove merely an attempt at intrigue an advance on the part of some impecunious lady who had secured his name from the chasseur it would be easy enough to withdraw he had only to explain the state of his finances so here he was he saw that the divan to the right of the fireplace was unoccupied threaded his way to it among the chairs and tables and over outstretched feet and asked the waiter for coffee he lighted a cigarette and glanced at his watch it was 9 40 the fire had a welcome warmth for he had still in his bones the chill of unheated austria from which he had arrived only that morning and he leaned forward elbows on knees and stretched out his hands to it indeed it was principally to get warm again that he had come to monte carlo but the chill was in his heart too and he shivered a little at thought of the pinched blue faces the hopeless eyes he was suddenly conscious that some one was standing beside him mr selden said a voice in an instant he was on his feet bowing above the hand that was held out to him his first impression was of that hand long nervous but giving the assurance of strength in reserve just the hand to have produced the writing of the note his next was of the eyes extraordinarily vivid under level brows with iris so distended that they seemed quite black though he was afterwards to see that they were a dark green shot with yellow how happy i am to see you again she said in a clear voice for the benefit of the idly observant room withdrew her hand and sank into a corner of the seat please get me some coffee she added and give me a cigarette her eyes met his as he held the match for her and a twinkle of amusement sprang into them your sister is well i hope she asked let me see it has been two years almost since i last saw her she is quite well thank you answered selden who by this time had pulled himself together and was quite ready to accept a hypothetical sister she is to be married next month he added as a slight contribution to the game how interesting to an american but of course tell me about it and then as the waiter served the coffee and passed on she moved closer to him and dropped her voice i do not wonder that you are astonished confess that i am not in the least what you expected i never expected to be so fortunate countered selden and permitted himself to appraise her there could be no question that she was most unusual she would be striking anywhere with her coal black hair her long pale face her vivid eyes and lips striking too in the way she was dressed without ornament in a narrow lanvin gown of black which seemed to be part of her to be moulded to her as a snake s skin is moulded then at second glance selden saw there was one ornament a queer stone of greenish yellow matching her eyes catching her gown together across the curve of her breasts but there were no pearls no brilliants not a single ring on her long fingers selden wondered if there were also no donor she took the coffee that he offered her and leaned back again in her corner as she sipped it slowly she looked across at him with level eyes and selden realized that she was also appraising him he had known at once of course that he had never seen her before and her glance seemed to indicate that he was equally unknown to her a dozen questions sprang to his lips but he held them back it was for her to begin and he was not quite sure of her status a woman of position evidently but as he looked at her he wondered whether the vividness of eyes and lips the even pallor of the face owed something a very tiny something to art if so it was consummate art such as one meets nowhere outside of france as for her age but he hesitated even to venture a guess i have wanted to know you for a long time mr selden she said softly at last you honour me the historian of the war the interpreter of the peace conference the champion of the league of nations the saviour of central europe she went on selden stiffened a little on guard against this irony there was upon her lips the merest shadow of a smile which might mean anything you seem extraordinarily well informed he said oh i hear people talk and you would be surprised i think to know how often your name is mentioned i have even read some of your articles you write rather well thank you said selden i am always striving to improve besides she added you are in a way a curiosity oh in many ways he protested you are the only man i know she went on leaning toward him who has not lost hope every one else sees only shipwreck and disaster but you do not seem to see that at all no agreed selden i don t i see three hundred million people freed of century old shackles and struggling toward the light she was silent a moment then she glanced around the room you can see that even here she asked it is rather difficult he admitted following her glance but after all these people are of no importance they are just wasters slackers headed for death just the same he added and stopped she laughed a little at the way he shut his jaws swear if you wish to i was thinking of some things i saw in vienna and southern poland not long ago again she gave him a long glance as though wondering whether she could trust him he was rather a queer looking fellow with a long smooth shaven face weather beaten and deeply lined but the steel grey eyes looked out steadily from under the heavy lashes and there was something in the set of the jaw that won confidence it was a powerful jaw with muscles that bunched up into little ridges on either side have you been to goritza recently she asked i was there last month did you meet the new ruler the question was asked indolently almost carelessly but there was in the voice a little quiver which struck selden s ear you mean the president jeneski yes he gave me an interview what did you think of him i thought him a remarkable man said selden looking at her and wondering if it was to ask these questions she had summoned him here but impractical a dreamer i have been told she supplemented impractical in some ways perhaps selden conceded a little of a fanatic as all reformers must be to get anything done but an electrical man full of fire and energy discouraged by nothing he is greatly handicapped by the poverty of the country and the ignorance of the people they are having a hard time to get along but at least they have got rid of the mediaeval dynasty which kept them in slavery for two hundred years was it as bad as that she asked the old king meant well enough and had his good moments but he was an absolute despot nobody could question his will there was nothing to hope for now they are free and happy of course she commented her lip curling a little it is difficult to be happy on an empty stomach if jeneski had two or three million dollars but since he has not well they must go to work and earn it and be glad they have something to work for and look forward to there are a lot of royalists left of course selden added who lament the good old days and would like to see jeneski overthrown there is the old nobility and all the hangers on who made money out of the court and who are now as poor as anybody so some day perhaps there will be a restoration no i don t think so restorations are expensive the royalists haven t any money and the old king is quite bankrupt i admire him for one thing though what is that jeneski told me they had offered him half a million dollars to renounce the throne and he refused it said that no king could renounce his throne any more than he could renounce his right hand or the colour of his hair not those words of course but that was the idea good old mediaeval divine right stuff i like him for that so do i and i m going to try to see him he s staying somewhere along the riviera isn t he yes at nice jeneski spoke also of the former prime minister a very able man yes the baron lappo he is with the king i believe so jeneski said he tried to detach him but it was no use lappo is devoted to the dynasty and of course they have some plot in hand well if it amuses them and selden shrugged his shoulders but they would better make haste in six months it will be too late jeneski will have his people with him does the king keep up a court over here i do not know but i have been told he lives very simply do you happen to know his grandson the crown prince danilo i have seen him he is often at the sporting club a great gambler i have heard it is in the blood said the girl with a little shrug his father was killed in a duel that followed a night of play selden looked at her again she seemed well informed about other things besides himself have you ever been to goritza he asked i was born there she answered quietly born there he echoed but you you well she asked smiling at his astonishment you look like a parisienne and you talk like an american i was taken to america when i was a child and grew up there she explained he waited for her to go on to elucidate the atmosphere of paris but she seemed lost in thought once he fancied her eyes wandered toward the door as though she were expecting some one there was some work he had planned to do that evening work he really ought to do besides an explanation was undoubtedly due him and it was time she made it in spite of himself he stirred nervously sit still a moment longer she laughed perceiving the movement i beg your pardon oh i am not offended i know how restless americans are and i know what is in your mind you have some work to do it is always so with an american but i have not yet told you why i wished to see you in the first place i desired to thank you for a very great service the greatest service a man can render a woman was she in earnest selden wondered she certainly seemed so and he tried to think what the greatest service was a man could render a woman there were so many services besides it depended on the woman and also on the man if it is a riddle i give it up he said how could i render you a service i have never seen you before no nor i you what was the service you rid me of a husband i hated selden leaned back in his corner and put the thought of work definitely behind him he had not expected anything like this that is interesting he commented you mean i ah put him out of the way she nodded her lips quivering of course said selden it would be foolish for me to deny that i have a long list of assassinations to my credit but i do not seem to recall this particular one i think the date will bring it back to your mind what was the date her face was ashen and her eyes burned into his could it be that she was in earnest the sixth of june 1918 she said hoarsely selden contracted his brows in an effort to remember where he had been on the sixth of june 1918 that was two years and a half ago and so much had happened the sixth of june yes of course that was a day he would remember all his life at dawn he had watched the marines straighten out their line toward torcy and late in the afternoon he had seen them go forward against belleau wood and bouresches he remembered the thrill with which he had learned of the order for the attack we were going in at last and he had hurried out of headquarters and clambered up to a little red roofed farm house looking down on belleau but what connection could all this have with the woman beside him and then his face stiffened at a sudden recollection you don t mean he stammered you can t possibly mean that you were the wife she nodded white to the lips then suddenly her face changed the blood rushed back into it and she was smiling gaily selden more astonished than ever looked around to see two men approaching one old and rather fat but with a keen distinguished face embellished by a monocle the other young and slim thirty at the most perhaps less than that dear countess cried the elder man in french and raised her hand and kissed it i have been searching for you everywhere permit me to present to you prince danilo my prince he added turning to the young man this is the countess remond of whom you have heard me so often speak a tragic memory as the prince bowed with much empressement above the slim hand extended to him selden was conscious of a rapid but penetrating scrutiny on the part of the older man it was as if an x ray had been plunged into the innermost recesses of his being photographed everything that was to be seen there and been instantly withdrawn he had never seen more remarkable eyes which was perhaps why their owner ambushed one of them behind a glass nor a more remarkable face alert high nosed finely coloured with a mouth at once forceful and good humoured and an air that bespoke wide knowledge and deep experience enchanted to meet you madame the prince was murmuring in the most approved fashion it is true that the baron has spoken often of you m le baron does me too much honour protested the countess impossible madame countered the baron to prove to you how much in earnest i am i have come all the way from nice expressly to pay you my respects having learned only this morning quite by accident that you were here why did you not inform me ah murmured the countess i know how busy you always are so it remained for me to learn it i know not how a voice on the promenade des anglais a bit of gossip at the casino a line in the petit nicois the countess remond is at the hotel de paris at least i lost no time i had my man confirm it over the telephone unhappily you were out so i could make no engagement but i came just the same and brought the prince with me hoping to be so fortunate as to find you free for the evening what is it you propose asked the countess who had listened to all this laughingly yet with a certain curious intentness as though seeking to find in it somewhere a code a key a hidden meaning i was going to propose the opera tosca you have of course heard it many times but there is a new tenor an american afterwards the club ciro s what you wish but if you are engaged and his eyes rested fleetingly upon selden this is m selden said the countess an old friend of mine in america whom i found sitting here a moment ago quite by accident m selden this is prince danilo of goritza and the baron lappo counsellor of kings and also an old friend of mine counsellor of one king only monsieur corrected the baron i find it enough you have heard of m selden added the countess you at least baron who read everything it was he who wrote those articles in the london times about our new republic they must have annoyed you deeply ah they did agreed the baron smiling i liked the ones on austria much better you must permit me monsieur to congratulate you on a splendid piece of work there we see eye to eye and let me add that i am happy indeed to meet you you will perhaps give me an opportunity to expose my point of view it is exactly what i hoped m le baron said selden i was saying to madame but a moment since that i must try to see the king yes that can be arranged he will welcome the opportunity i will let you know the baron paused a moment and looked him over with a quizzical smile you are a great republican hein he asked i also in theory though perhaps you will not believe it it is true but not for my country no there i am a monarchist i do not believe our people are ready for a republic in another generation perhaps but not now they require education but we will talk of all that some other time perhaps you would care to hear la tosca once again i have a box i should be most happy thank you said selden but i have some work to do even at monte carlo i try to do a little ah you americans murmured the baron it is no wonder you own the world i will speak to the king to morrow you shall hear from me you are staying at this hotel yes m le baron and thank you au revoir said the countess and held out her hand i am so glad to have seen you again and i shall not forget our engagement for to morrow at twelve shall we say selden was quick to bow assent at twelve he agreed till to morrow then said the countess and moved away the plump but altogether distinguished baron on one side and the tall rather commonplace prince on the other a strange trio selden told himself as he stood for a moment looking after them at the graceful lines of the woman s figure at the baron s head with its grey hair parted down the back after the ancient manner at the prince s negligent walk and careless air a little too careless perhaps to be quite genuine and yet perhaps not for the face was careless too with its dark skin and shining eyes and sensuous mouth not a bad face but rather a weak one as of a man who no longer found any cause worth fighting for they had paused a moment to get some wraps from the vestiaire and the countess looked back at him and smiled then they passed through the door together and selden shaking himself out of his thoughts betook himself to his room there he changed into an old dressing gown and disreputable slippers got his pipe to going sat down at his desk and plunged resolutely into the article he was finishing for the times long practice had perfected his ability to switch his mind at will from one subject to another and for the hour that followed he was not at monte carlo but at neustadt in central austria witnessing the loading of a long red cross train with half starved children to be taken away into switzerland to be fed it was the only way to save them no one realized that better than their mothers but there had been scenes for to many of the women these pale little wraiths were all that the war had left them he leaned back at last with a sigh of satisfaction then got his manuscript together looked it over made a correction here and there sealed it up addressed it summoned the porter and sent it off that done he filled his pipe again stretched out on the chaise longue and allowed his mind to wander back over the events of the evening a strange trio each remarkable especially the baron to talk with him would be worth while his point of view was certain to be interesting and might after all be the right one as for the prince he seemed to be little more than a puppet in the baron s hands he had certainly given the impression of being led around led up to the countess to be introduced led to the opera perhaps that was the price he paid for freedom in other directions and crown princes were destined to be puppets more or less as for the countess evidently a woman of the world wise in its ways refined in its furnace but also a little hardened curious how when the baron was speaking she seemed always to be watching for her cue perhaps it was really a drama that was preparing with these three for the protagonists and perhaps he too would have a part a minor one of course but to be behind the scenes would be something that was where he loved to be behind the scenes not involved in the action but free to watch the strings that worked the puppets and to try to trace them to their controlling source it was great luck too good to be true he was letting his imagination run away with him but how else explain the sudden interest of the countess remond to suppose that she had summoned him to a rendezvous merely to thank him that was absurd she would not waste her time like that no there was some other purpose and the baron and the prince had arrived at a most inopportune moment for she was just upon the verge of explanation or had she been expecting them all the while was that why her eyes had sought the door and this engagement for to morrow which she had suddenly evolved what did that mean well to morrow would tell but he realized that he had need to be on guard he recalled her strange face her burning eyes her vivid mouth who was she what was she a woman with a furnace inside her no novice certainly but neither was he a novice a fierce woman how her face had hardened when she had mentioned that date the sixth of june 1918 selden s hardened too for he was not likely ever to forget the happenings of that day one happening in particular at two o clock in the afternoon in the old farm house which had been the home of some quiet peasant family for a hundred years but which was now the headquarters of general harbord commanding the marine brigade of the second division he had seen an order typed off which marked the beginning of the american offensive it was an order that at five o clock the marines should advance against belleau wood and the village of bouresches the marines had taken over their present positions from the french only a few hours before and the germans would count on their waiting to get settled before doing any attacking therefore there was every reason to expect the advantage of surprise in any event as general harbord remarked the way to act in an active sector was to be active copies were made of the order and a minute later two dispatch bearers were pounding away toward the lines to convey them to the regimental commanders selden tingling with excitement resolved to watch the advance from the very best position discoverable and for the next hour scouted up and down behind the lines he found at last a place which seemed ideal a tiny farm house with red tiled roof partially blown away looking down from a little knoll upon both wood and village he assured himself that the place was deserted and that there was a ladder by which he could reach the roof then walked over to the little orchard and lay down in the shade to rest he must have dozed for he was roused suddenly by a clatter of explosions the beginning of the attack he told himself and then as he started to rise saw a motor cycle wheel swiftly into the yard beside the house and stop the rider whom he recognized as one of the couriers from headquarters sprang to the ground and after a quick look around entered the house he was out again in a moment gathering up some bits of wood and dried grass which he took back into the house then he drew a cupful of gasolene from the tank of his motor cycle and hurried into the house again selden watching motionless told himself bitterly that he would have to seek another vantage point evidently this place was going to be used by the army he would inquire and he was just rising to his feet when he was astounded to see a thin column of smoke rising from the chimney the day was windless and the smoke rose straight into the air then suddenly it stopped started again stopped started again five distinct puffs floated upward toward the sky then the smoke stopped for good and a moment later the dispatch rider emerged flung himself into the saddle and was off selden lay staring after him trying to understand it had been a signal of course but to whom to our men but why use so clumsy a method when there were telephones everywhere to the germans the thought brought him bounding to his feet and in another moment he was racing down the hill but he lost his way in a strip of woods he ran into a deep ravine which delayed him and then into a stretch of bog around which he had to work his way and even as he panted up the road toward headquarters the earth burst asunder with the thunder of the artillery preparation general harbord listened to the gasped out story with a face of granite and called his chief of staff have we time to stop the attack he asked impossible sir said the chief there is just a minute and a half we should only disorganize it so they sat and waited through a minute which seemed like an hour and then the reports came pouring in of the massed machine gun fire which had greeted the attack at the very outset of the rifles waiting in the woods oh yes our men had gone on but the casualties were very heavy especially among the officers yes colonel catlin too the germans had seemed to know the very minute to expect them there was a brief trial late that night and a swift conviction the accused had denied nothing admitted nothing merely shrugging his shoulders as he listened to selden s story and realized the game was up asking only that he might write a letter to his wife and at dawn a firing squad had ended the affair selden had of course not seen the letter but it shocked him now to think that the woman to whom the man wrote that night was the lovely being who had summoned him to a rendezvous he had made no inquiries indeed had sought to drop the whole sordid incident out of his consciousness but now he began to wonder who the man really was how had he managed to win this gorgeous woman what had he said in the letter the censor of course would permit him to say little except good bye certainly he would not permit him to mention selden s name or even to refer to him indirectly most probably the letter had never been sent at all had been simply turned over to the intelligence department but in that case how had she known in any case how had she known the thought brought him bolt upright it would have been wiser to keep that strange trio under observation he had been wrong to yield to the feeling that he was in the way that the baron had come to monte carlo merely to pay his respects and introduce the prince selden did not for an instant believe and what place better than an opera box for a discreet talk decidedly he should have gone along perhaps it was not yet too late he glanced at his watch yes eleven forty five the opera was over but there remained ciro s and the sporting club in another instant he was kicking off his slippers and reaching for his shoes a duo at the opera the opera at monte carlo is housed in the end of the casino building nearest the hotel de paris so that the countess remond and her two companions had only to cross the street it was to the private entrance that the baron led the way here the prince paused do you require me any longer he asked perhaps you would better go in and be seen with us for a moment said the baron the prince nodded curtly and the three followed a deferential gold laced flunkey up the red carpeted stair and into a box it is a masterpiece of its kind this opera house the work of that charles garnier who built the paris opera and whose style if too gay and florid for a temple dedicated to the classics is admirably suited to the frivolous atmosphere of monte carlo outside it is a medley of columns mosaics lyres masks and minarets inside of gilding garlands friezes and frescoes vigorous young women support the domed ceiling naked youths perch precariously on the cornices one is confused and intimidated by the riot of colour and decoration but gradually one gets used to it and the auditorium itself is admirable a single floor of comfortable seats stretching below the boxes down to the stage there are three large boxes the central one with gilded canopy being reserved for monaco s prince it was into one of the others that the baron s party was shown and the baron after assisting the countess to a seat himself sat down and looked out across the audience toward the stage the prince refused the chair proffered by the attendant and stood leaning against the side of the box as though poised for flight the play had proceeded to the second act and scarpia was explaining his evil designs to tosca while her lover was being melodiously tortured off stage the baron looked only long enough to see that della rizza was singing tosca and dinh gilly scarpia and then having heard them many times he turned his attention from the stage to the audience this audience with the reputation of being the most blase in the world was lolling in its seats listening perfunctorily to the music and almost visibly digesting a too generous dinner not until scarpia had died with a last convulsion and tosca had placed the candles on either side of his head and the curtain had come down and the lights gone up did it stir then it rose to its feet as by a common impulse and surged forth into the pillared atrium to walk up and down and get a little gentle exercise and look itself over but the baron did not rise instead he drew his chair further back into the recesses of the box go my prince he said and take a look at the ladies only i pray you do not enter the rooms i have an affair of importance to discuss with our dear countess the prince disappeared in an instant and the baron leaned back with a sigh if he were only more serious he said but he resembles that great great uncle for whom he was named intelligent generous but entirely mad when it comes to women and games of chance his father was also a little like that was he not asked the countess with a smile yes it is true and the baron sighed again but he was also more earnest more interested in affairs of state it was a great blow to the king when he was killed suddenly like that his eldest son he knew nothing about it until they came bringing the body now all his hopes are centred in this boy who causes us so many anxieties he is still young the countess pointed out and he is at least discreet one hears nothing of his love affairs ah there at least we have been fortunate said the baron for some years now there has been only one it has grown more serious than i like yet it is far better than the ruinous affairs in which he might have been involved but to the gambling there is no end as long as he can find a sou in his pocket he has a sort of vertigo when he sees the tables with the wheels going round and the banknotes falling here and there and the croupiers calling the numbers a vertigo that is how he describes it fortunately at present he has no money and i know no one of whom he can borrow his debts i think have reached the limit there is perhaps some comfort in that he added grimly during this discourse as before that evening the countess listened as though waiting for a cue and finding none why did you send for me she asked abruptly because i have need of you of course but in what way we are preparing to place the king back on his throne she shrugged sceptically and i take it for granted went on the baron with a sudden unveiling of his eyes that you would not be sorry to see jeneski punished his work undone his dream broken her face was livid as she returned his look yes she said thickly i should be glad of that i thought so said the baron and polished his glass abstractedly but it is impossible it is not impossible it is all but arranged one little impulse more and it is done you will supply that impulse i warn you said the countess that i shall have to know everything before i consent you shall know everything agreed the baron and furthermore i can promise you if we succeed not only shall we say satisfaction but a material reward a substantial one we can speak of that later said the countess after i have consented but why do you come to me what is it i can do i come to you replied the baron in the first place because you are a clever woman and in the second place because you have lived in america for a long time and i suppose you understand that people as for me i confess i never do you mean the women but naturally the men they are not difficult to understand though i sometimes wonder if they can really be as simple as they appear they are said the countess children bad ones sometimes but still children good at heart they seem so to me agreed the baron then it is not this m selden no though he is important also unfortunately at this moment it is the question of a woman two women perhaps even three women it is a difficult matter very difficult but there is one thing that simplifies it one of these women is very ambitious and very ignorant that goes without saying commented the countess if she is a rich american but if you will cease speaking in riddles the baron laughed here is the history he said it is a peculiar one such as could happen nowhere but in america this woman when she was quite young worked as a waitress in a public restaurant at a place in the western part of the united states called denver she met there one day a young man who was a miner married him and went back with him into the mountains to search for gold that was admirable was it not they kept searching for a long time and they did not find any gold but at last they found copper a mountain of it my informant tells me that this is not an exaggeration that it was really a mountain though it is there no longer this young man had no money and to develop a mine of copper even when you have it all together in one mountain takes a great deal for a long time nobody believed his story about this mountain but at last he secured enough money from some men in denver to build a little mill but it was not profitable partly because it was far from the market and the railroad would not extend itself for such a small mill but principally because it was necessary to pay so high wages to the men who worked the mill it was very hard to get any men at all and they could charge what they pleased so the mill had to be closed and it looked as though the man had failed that he would have to sell his mountain for a very small sum the years were passing neither the man nor the woman were as young as they had been especially the woman she had had two children she was discouraged she wanted him to sell but he would not now regard how strange are the ways of providence one day a young man came to him and said i hear you cannot work your mill because labour is so dear that is so said the other then i have a proposal to make i have some friends in the country from which i come strong active young men like myself who wish to come to america but who have no money if you will bring them to america they will work for you for two years and you will give them but to eat and sleep after that we will arrange a fair wage eh bien the man raised money enough to bring to america twenty of these young men and they went to work for him they worked well and soon twenty more were brought over and then fifty more and then a hundred more at the end of five years a little city had grown up at the foot of that mountain of copper and the man who had made the proposal to bring over the first ones governed it and all the men in that city came from my country the baron paused for a moment to enjoy the start of surprise which the countess could not wholly repress so it is that story you are telling me she said shall i go on she nodded and settled a little farther back into the shadow the people were well treated continued the baron they lived better than they had ever lived they saved money and sent it home that their families might join them but beyond everything they piled up a great an enormous fortune for the man who had discovered the mountain and his wife soon forgot that she had at one time worked in a restaurant ah yes murmured the countess with a strange smile and her children never knew it perhaps so agreed the baron searching her face with his keen eyes i do not know but at last we began to suspect that we had been wrong to permit so many of our young men to go to america to work for this man of copper though we had been glad enough at the time since we had no work for them at home but they were always writing back about america about how well things were there about liberty some of them came back from time to time and talked too much and too wildly the climax which we should have foreseen came at last a bomb was thrown at the king the baron paused as though to contemplate to say a prayer before an act so terrible so sacrilegious continue my friend encouraged the countess i find this history immensely entertaining no doubt you already know most of it suggested the baron even if i do it gains new interest from your manner of telling please go on as for the rest i will be brief we found that that bomb had been thrown by a man who had come back from america expressly for that purpose he said so quite frankly he told us that another would succeed where he had failed that our country was to be made a republic like america we laughed and hanged him but it gave us to think so we sent agents to america they unearthed for us the history which i have just recounted and they found it was indeed true that over there they were plotting against us their leader the man who ruled them who organized them who collected their money who furnished all the brains was a radical an anarchist who fifteen years before had been forced to flee from goritza for his life and who is now the president of the new republic broke in the countess in a word jeneski it is true the world sometimes seems to me to be upside down and the baron rubbed a puzzled hand over his head i do not yet know how it happened but in those last days of the war when everything was falling to pieces but when we thought ourselves firmly re established he suddenly appeared won over what was left of the army and in an hour we were fleeing for the frontier with the crown jewels and the contents of the treasury said the countess the baron smiled a deprecatory smile the treasury was all but empty and as for the jewels they belonged to the king besides their value has been much exaggerated most unfortunately if they had been worth more my task would be an easier one the countess smiled it was impossible to be annoyed with the baron please finish the story she said the audience was beginning to filter back into its seats for the last act there is but a word more as i said just now i am going to place the king back on his throne then the jewels are not all sold alas long since well the baron s eyes were burning as he leaned forward toward her well do you know what i propose the most ironic coup in history i propose to use for our king the millions heaped up for that king of copper by the very men who are now ruling in our stead superb is it not she was staring at him striving to understand but before she could speak the lights went out there came a sharp rap from the conductor and the orchestra began alliance this time it was the baron who attended and the countess who was distraught the story he had told her had awakened memories and emotions deeper more violent than he suspected and though she managed to keep her face serene she was on fire within whereas the baron assured that he was making progress could abandon himself to a new sensation the pleasure of hearing e lucevan le stelle incomparably sung by a voice as smooth as soft as iridescent as the satin in old flemish paintings for john mccormack was making his debut as mario that evening and it was not until this moment that he found himself and the audience sat spellbound and listened there was no resisting the wild applause which refused to be silenced perhaps the singer after the shortcomings of the earlier acts welcomed the opportunity to show what he could do at any rate he nodded to m lauweryns who was waiting expectantly with raised baton it is not possible for him to sing it again like that cried an excited woman s voice but he did perhaps even a shade more perfectly come let us go said the baron when it was over let us keep that voice fresh in our ears it is a pity he is so uncouth he added as he laid the countess s wrap about her shoulders it must annoy him very much now let us look for that scapegrace of mine they descended together to the atrium but the prince was not among the people loitering there the public gaming rooms beyond were jammed with the usual sordid crowd shabby old men and women to whom the tables were the breath of life who spent week after week month after month watching the wheel and recording every play in the hope of discovering a system cheap adventurers striving to pick up a few francs half starved shop girls risking their last little notes with trembling hands harpies of the underworld trying to attach themselves to any man who seemed to be winning all the ugly tattered repulsive fringes of society he would not be here said the baron and hastened through the tainted atmosphere to the private rooms beyond but neither was the prince there and after a vain look around the baron had a word with the chief inspector m le prince was here said the inspector but only for a moment he met some one he knew a young man a newcomer an american apparently not yet known to the attendants they went away together perhaps to the sporting club thank you we shall see said the baron as he turned away the countess who had listened to all this with the utmost indifference suppressed a slight yawn if you will see me to my hotel she suggested the baron came back with a start to the obligations of the moment you see how it is he protested i am no longer myself these affairs grow too much for me it is a sign that i am getting old you will forgive me will you not but yes run along and search for your prince confound the prince said the baron let us go to ciro s i am sure you are thirsty besides i have still much to say to you the countess hesitated it would not do to be too docile to this lappo a little discipline might strengthen her position prove that you forgive me he urged very well she agreed after all she wanted to hear what he had still to tell her alors he went on half to himself as they moved together back through the rooms the worst that he can do is to borrow some money from this new friend one debt more that is nothing there are already so many the countess looked at him with a little smile why do you do it she asked do what annoy yourself in this way if your country chooses to be a republic why not go and amuse yourself somewhere else paris is much livelier than goritza it is in my blood said the baron with a shrug of helplessness my great grandfather placed the first ghita on the throne and established the kingdom my grandfather enlarged it my father consolidated it it was left for me to see it fall to pieces in company with so many others i cannot go away and leave it something inside me something stronger than myself compels me to labour to expend myself to set it up again it is a duty i cannot escape a curse rather corrected the countess perhaps so yes perhaps it is a curse yet i have had my moments and he fell silent smiling at recollection of some of them the attendants saluted respectfully as they passed through the doors and down the steps out into the night to the right ciro s great electric sign flamed high against the sky dimming the stars the countess glanced at it with a shiver of repulsion at thought of the crowded restaurant let us not go to ciro s she said impulsively i prefer the terrace certainly assented the baron we shall be taken for lovers if i were ten years younger do not be silly you will be warm enough oh yes she said and together they turned to the left around the end of the building and down the steps to the terrace which overlooks the sea they found a seat just back of the balustrade and sat for a moment without speaking looking out into the night warm jewelled scented like a woman to the right glowed the green and red beacons marking the harbour entrance and above them a string of lights mounted along the road to the summit of the rock where the prince of monaco has his palace and his great museum in front of them stretched the mediterranean faintly phosphorescent breaking into white here and there and lapping rhythmically against the rocky beach to the left another row of lights marked the road along the shore stretching far out into the water along the western edge of cap martin the beauty the silence the repose fell like a balm upon the baron s troubled spirit he exhaled slowly from his lungs the fetid air of the casino and took a long breath of the perfumed night some of his years fell from him his memory at least turned back to another night long ago when he had sat with the only woman he had ever loved beside him on the terrace at montreaux looking out across lake leman love and the baron one could smile now to find those words together but there had been a time and perhaps vera countess remond also had her momentary vision but she was younger and so less sentimental than the baron she also had her pressing problems and it was she who broke the spell you were saying you needed my help she said is it to bewitch this american copper king into giving you his money in that case i warn you that i shall try first to get it for myself the baron who had come back to the present with a start looked about him to make sure they could not be overheard but the terrace was deserted save for a few other couples snuggled together on the benches and a blue coated gardien pacing solemnly up and down no he said it is not that at all this king like all kings was mortal you had not heard i have heard nothing he has been dead nearly a year ah said the countess understanding suddenly it is the widow yes a terrifying woman the countess smiled at his tone is it she who is ambitious immeasurably so you are going to marry her to the king no said the baron rubbing his ear thoughtfully i had considered that the lady would not be difficult but the king rebelled he pointed out that he had married once for the good of his kingdom and that once was all that could be demanded of any man besides that would be a little too a little too well not exactly in the best taste and finally the ghitas have a law that never shall the head of the house marry a widow of course in an affair of this importance these fine drawn questions of taste might be disregarded and the king could always abrogate the law but he is inexorable not even to regain his throne will he marry a middle aged american widow no doubt he fears to appear ridiculous suggested the countess oh the good pietro never cared much about appearances said the baron what he fears is to lose his freedom i do not blame him he added impartially well then asked the countess what is it you propose there is the prince said the baron but surely you do not suppose that he will marry a middle aged american widow oh no said the baron he will marry the daughter he was gazing out across the water and so did not see the sudden wave of colour which flooded the woman s face and then receded leaving it deadly white she sat very still as though holding herself with iron bands and turned her head away and took a slow deep tremulous breath then she touched her handkerchief to her lips and when she took it away there was a tiny stain of blood upon it will she consent she asked in a muffled voice i am not sure said the baron it is there i am baffled it is there i count upon you yes go on her mother does all she can to persuade her but unfortunately it seems that in america girls are permitted to choose for themselves yes said the countess a little breathlessly what does she say she says very little she sits and listens looking very far away she is an unusual girl she could be charming if she wished for some reason she does not wish it is strange in one so young also she has brains perhaps her father s certainly not her mother s the alliance has been proposed to her then yes it is arranged it waits only upon her consent and she hesitates it is very strange there seem to be two forces at work in her one urging her on one holding her back it is not ambition that urges her on i am sure of that and it is not love the prince leaves her indifferent but whatever it is i feel that it will win unless something happens what can happen asked the countess ah madame sighed the baron it is a situation of infinite delicatesse the scales are so nicely balanced that a breath will sway them if i could only comprehend the psychology of the american young woman does she know more than she should or less than she should what really goes on inside her head i confess i sometimes grow confused talking to this one then there is the prince added the baron sighing again he is already married i have heard so nodded the countess morganatically which is of course no marriage at all and much better than indiscriminate affairs it is as i have explained to the mother like marrying a man who has been divorced americans do not object to that but what i fear what must not take place is a scene an encounter that would ruin everything she is here then she is at the hotel de paris she goes by the name of madame ghita the prince sees her but of course he has been extraordinarily faithful that is what i meant when i said that his affair had become too serious but i can manage that he will not dare disobey his grandfather well asked the countess a little impatiently what is it you want me to do two things said the baron you will permit me to introduce you to madame davis and her daughter you are the sort of friend they need to instruct them in savoir faire to make of them so far as it is possible women of the world you will show them the absurdity of the provincial point of view yes and the other to speak to this woman whom the prince married in paris to gain her confidence if you can to convince her that her interest lies in keeping quiet that otherwise the prince will be a pauper unable to give her a son i will empower you to make her a definite offer a most generous one i should think you could do that more effectively yourself said the countess i have tried said the baron sadly but to me she will not listen she speaks of such a thing as love women do sometimes commented the countess and i am disarmed added the baron because i admire her because my heart speaks for her she is a remarkable woman much too clever for the prince but you will see you have said no word of m selden the countess pointed out why did you send me such elaborate instructions with regard to him even some of his articles to read the baron laughed softly if i may say so he answered i am something of an artist i like my pictures to be complete and harmonious we must consider how the world and especially england will receive the announcement of this marriage for its object will be at once plain to every one selden is a man of great influence his articles are read everywhere i have sometimes even fancied that he is responsible for the reluctance which mlle davis shows in what way it seems that she has read his glowing account of our new republic we have discussed it together and i have pointed out his errors but she is not convinced if he could be brought to our point of view and would tell her so i am certain the affair would be settled moreover an article or two in the proper vein would do much to influence public opinion he does not seem easily impressed said the countess reflectively i do not expect you to impress him explained the baron hastily it would be folly to think of approaching him in that way but i hope to prove to him that the king with millions in his hands can do much more for our country than jeneski and it is true what we propose is for the country s good i am certain i can make him see it but my part will be to keep him amused impress him if you can but be very careful above all talk to him and find out what he is thinking the countess gazed unseeingly out across the water at last the baron s intentions lay clear before her well he asked my dear baron said the countess i have not forgotten all i owe to you ah when one begins in that tone interjected the baron with a gesture of disappointment but wait i am not refusing i am only asking myself whether i can really be of service if i can you may rely upon me as you know i have my own reasons a little convulsion ran across her face the baron was looking at her keenly yes first i must meet these americans and this madame ghita after that we shall see the baron took her hand and raised it to his lips you have given me an enchanted hour my dear he said but i understand she laughed one hour is all you can allow yourself it is true he assented dismally the countess rose take me to my hotel she said then you can go search for your scapegrace madame ghita the sporting club at monte carlo is a creation of recent years an effort on the part of m blanc and his associates to meet the demand for a place where one can gamble longer and higher and more variously than is possible at the casino so here the wheels revolve and the cards fall until four in the morning instead of stopping at midnight and to roulette and trente et quarante is added baccara with the sky as the only limit it is supposed to be more select this club and the proviso is made of requiring an introduction but introducers can be picked up any morning on the terrace or the management of any of the hotels will supply them if requested so that any one of fairly presentable appearance and willing to pay a hundred and fifty francs for the privilege may gamble there as long as his money lasts the club is housed in a beautiful building of white stone just around the corner from the hotel de paris so selden had only a few steps to go his card and the payment of the fee admitted him for he had been introduced the year before and in a moment the electric lift had carried him noiselessly to the gaming room de luxe which occupies the length of the upper story it was filled with a crowd of which at least two thirds were women the same sort of women he had seen earlier in the hotel lounge and the air was stale and heavy with perfume and tobacco it was a strangely silent crowd sitting or standing with eyes intent upon the tables the only sounds being those incident to the game the voices of the croupiers inviting their patrons to place their bets the quick whir of the ivory ball about the rim of the roulette wheel the warning that no more bets could be placed the rattle of the ball falling into a compartment the announcement of the winning number and the clatter of the little rakes pulling in the bank s winnings it is less picturesque and exciting than in the days before the war for then the wagers were made in gold and there was the clink of coins and the gleam of yellow metal which men have always found so fascinating but now gold circulates no more in europe and wagers are made with disks of coloured celluloid purchased from the croupiers with the paper notes which have been pouring so freely from the printing presses and if one wins it is with this same flimsy paper that one is paid a fool s game truly selden threaded his way among the groups looking for the countess and her companions but he succeeded in discovering only the prince he was seated at the end of a table next to the croupier and at the moment selden caught sight of him he was drawing toward himself a pile of notes which the croupier in charge of the bank had just counted out and pushed toward him he seemed to be well known or perhaps one of the attaches had noised his identity about as an advertisement and a curious crowd was watching his proceedings selden assured himself that neither the countess nor lappo was in the rooms then he returned to watch too for he was curious to learn something of the prince s personality one glance at his face was enough to show that gambling was indeed as the countess had said in his blood he was the true type utterly oblivious of the crowd about him his dark skin aglow with inward fire but entirely calm and collected cold as ice indeed he was playing without hesitation or timidity relying apparently upon some inward guidance which he trusted implicitly and upon which he was ready to wager his last franc with a run of luck a gambler of this type sometimes wins enormously but on the other hand when luck is bad it requires not many turns of the wheel to take away all he has and the wheel turns very rapidly at this moment the prince was having a run of luck and the crowd was watching to see how far it would take him while a few were trying to follow his plays and get the advantage of his luck while it lasted he was playing the number twenty seven with maximums not only en plein but also on the cheveaux the carres and the transversales a total of about six thousand francs and twenty seven had issued three times in the last fifteen plays in other words in fifteen plays the prince had lost seventy thousand francs and won two hundred thousand and as selden watched twenty seven came again and another sixty thousand was added to the prince s winnings a murmur of excitement ran through the watching group for the chef de partie had rung a little bell and had sent the attendant who answered it to the cashier for more money which is as near to breaking the bank as any one can come it is now that he should quit said a woman at selden s side if he keeps on he will only lose perhaps the voice reached the prince s ears or perhaps some such thought was in his mind for he hesitated as his stake was swept away after the next play and passed his hand before his eyes as though awaking from a dream he tried again however and lost a second time and lost a third time and lost then he tossed a thousand franc note to the croupier folded up his winnings and thrust them into his pocket and made his way through a respectful crowd to the buffet it was not until then that selden perceived the prince had a companion a blonde young man who had been sitting next to him rose as he did with an approving nod and disappeared into the buffet with him selden scarcely had time to look at him but he got the impression that he was very young and also that he was an american the prince had found a new victim perhaps ah m selden said a voice at his elbow and he turned to find the baron lappo smiling up at him the work is finished then yes i got it off answered selden and glanced behind the baron and on either side of him the countess decided she would not come to night said the baron interpreting the look i also would have sought my bed the old need the sleep of beauty even more than the young but alas i have responsibilities have you by any chance seen our little prince yes said selden smiling at the adjective i think you will find him in the buffet so long as he is not playing and the baron breathed a sigh of relief he has been playing breaking the bank in fact what he has won exclaimed the baron hugely then i am indeed alarmed i must seek him you will join us i hope with pleasure said selden and followed the baron across the room the old diplomat was evidently well known and highly esteemed for he had many respectful salutations to acknowledge but the buffet was reached at last the prince and the blonde young man seated on a banquette in one corner were watching a waiter fill their glasses with champagne the baron s face darkened as he saw the prince s companion imbecile he muttered under his breath and advanced straight upon them the prince raising his glass to his lips raised his eyes also and saw the baron come along my old one he cried no whit discomposed by the baron s stormy face you also m selden two more glasses he added to the waiter not for me at this hour protested the baron a demi vittel and as the waiter hurried away he turned to the blonde youth i am happy to meet you again m davis he said i hope that your mother and your sister are well oh yes thank you davis responded permit me to introduce a compatriot of yours m selden went on the baron happy to meet you said davis with a negligent nod selden reflected that davis did not seem particularly glad to see the baron he was a good looking youth too young for his face to have taken on much character evidently self willed and probably spoiled by that mother and sister for whom the baron had inquired the baron was regarding the prince with a mildly ironic glance i hear you have been winning he said yes i had an inspiration for twenty seven the prince replied it is a long time he added to selden since i have had any luck perhaps it is the turn of the tide selden suggested i hope so and he raised the glass the waiter had filled for him thank you it was time said the prince and the three young men drank while the baron sipped his water moodily you do not seem pleased m le baron added the prince looking at him for you to win said the baron with a grimace it is so unusual like the sun rising in the west i am wondering what great misfortune is about to happen and he added a sentence in a language which selden did not understand his native tongue no doubt the prince flushed rebelliously and the baron spoke another sentence in a tone more peremptory the prince nodded sulkily and rose you will excuse us for a moment said the baron rising too and he slipped his arm through that of the prince and led him away davis stared after them speculatively until they disappeared through the door into the outer room queer duck the baron he remarked and refilled his glass i wonder what game he is up to now i met him just this evening said selden but i rather like him oh he s all right agreed davis deucedly clever and all that makes me feel like i belong in the infant class but he is too blamed serious and he seems to think the whole world centres in that little speck he calls his country i give you my word i hunted it on the map for half an hour the other day before i found it and then i could scarcely see it do you know anything about it yes i ve been there the deuce you have now tell me and he leaned closer did this old king really amount to anything how do you mean i mean did his position amount to anything was he really a king or was he just a joke of course he was a king the social equal of any other king he married his children into the most exclusive courts of europe yes i know that and if he got back again it would be the same thing if he got back he might have even more prestige said selden since there are fewer kings in business these days and to get back would be a great feat i see said davis and settled back again in his corner selden wondered what interest this youth could possibly have in the king s restoration just his friendship with the prince no doubt it was evident that he had been drinking too much just enough too much to flush his face and loosen his tongue he could not be over twenty and in spite of his good looks there was something in his mouth and chin which spoke of weakness and self indulgence and it was also plain that his inhibitions to indiscreet utterance were not as strong as they should have been selden was well aware that nothing is more revealing of a man s character than a glass of champagne too much it loosens the tongue of the weak man the ordinary man breaks down his reserve and prods him on to talk carelessly and boastfully to prove his importance at whatever cost but with the strong man the effect is quite the contrary he grows more guarded with every glass the result perhaps of breeding of wisdom gained by experience at any rate in vino veritas does not work with him but young davis was not at all of this class it was plain that he had neither breeding nor experience and selden told himself that a boy like that should be at work or at least in college not lounging in the monte carlo sporting club with no one to look after him the thing i particularly object to in the baron went on davis reverting to his original grievance after the manner of slightly tipsy men is that he seems to think i need a guardian on this point selden thoroughly agreed with the baron but he didn t say so in what way he inquired oh he s all the time trying to keep the prince away from me seems to be afraid to leave us alone together good gad if he only knew and he chuckled to himself are you staying here selden asked to change the subject he had some scruples about encouraging champagne confidences no we ve got a villa over at cimiez just above nice you know but i m over here a good part of the time dingy place nice don t you think yes i do i don t believe i ve seen you before no i got in just this morning from paris no from austria davis looked at him with sudden interest as though struck by a new idea what did you say your name is he asked my name is selden selden that s it you re not the chap who has been writing those articles in the times yes selden admitted but you don t mean to say you ve read them oh no davis hastened to assure him too heavy for me but my sister has she s nutty about them i say can t you come over and have lunch with us to morrow sorry said selden drily but i have an engagement he had no desire to discuss central europe with immature americans but look here davis protested and then he sprang to his feet so violently that he nearly upset the table there you are at last he cried his face beaming selden turned to find that two women had approached and were standing just behind him two most unusual women both young but one the younger and prettier evidently jeune fille the other the elder and more striking just as evidently a poised and finished woman of the world m le prince ees e not ere inquired the latter in delightful english and she permitted her eyes to rest calmly and inquiringly upon selden who had also risen as though asking what right he had to be there and what manner of man he was we are waiting for him davis explained the baron took him away a minute ago ah le baron and she made a moue of distaste im i ave no wish to see and she started to move away but look here protested davis the prince is expecting you i want to see you farceur eet is cicette you wish to see she laughed and glanced at the pretty girl beside her and indeed it was at cicette that davis had been gazing insufferable young fool selden told himself to look at cicette mere milk and water beside this other woman so distinguished so unusual so surely poised not beautiful exactly but with such charm such magnetism again her eyes were resting upon his do you speak french monsieur she inquired in that language yes madame then say to this young man for my english gives me shame that we are going back for half an hour of chemin de fer if he and m le prince care to join us before that good if not we will look in here again on our way out thank you she added when selden had passed this on come cicette as she turned away her eyes met his again in that same questioning impersonal regard yet it was not altogether impersonal for somehow at bottom it was deeply intimate if one could only tear away a veil looking after her he noted the exquisite poise of her head how superbly she moved like a queen no he had never seen a queen who walked like that why the devil hadn t davis introduced him cicette glanced back over her shoulder and gave davis an encouraging nod and smile as she passed from sight that young man who had been watching fascinated dropped into his seat again and poured himself out some more wine isn t she a corker he demanded she is certainly a pretty girl agreed selden and was tempted to add a word of caution but checked himself after all it was no affair of his who is she her name is cicette fayard she is a niece of madame ghita believe me madame takes good care of her never lets her out of her sight makes me feel like a beast of prey i ve been trying to pick up some french so i can talk to her but i haven t made much out of it yet madame ghita repeated selden that is the name of the elder one davis nodded ghita selden repeated the word to himself for it had awakened some faint echo of recognition in his brain ghita where had he heard that before for the life of him he couldn t remember she looks like a clever woman he said she is clever agreed davis the cleverest woman i ve ever known he spoke as though he had known hundreds is she a pole asked selden poles are sometimes very clever and the name sounds polish oh that s her husband s name said davis i don t know for sure but i fancy she s french again some memory stirred in selden s brain more strongly her husband s name ghita and then it came like a flash ghita that was the family name of the old dynasty the family name of the prince on the shortcomings of republics selden did not attempt to explain to himself his sudden interest in this fascinating unknown but he was determined to find out about her all that he could his first impulse had been to chide davis for not introducing him but he suppressed it if the lady was married and especially if she was married to a ghita davis might not have felt himself a free agent though selden doubted if he was even aware of the continental point of view in that regard more probably it was merely lack of savoir faire even without an introduction the lady had not hesitated to address him she was not then too much bound by convention but this was not a drawing room it was the sporting club at monte carlo and she was not drinking tea she was playing chemin de fer these were points that were worth thinking over selden offered davis a cigarette before lighting one himself but davis did not see it his eyes were still fixed on the door through which the women had disappeared evidently the net was already around him so she is married is she selden remarked casually is her husband with her here what and davis came to himself with a start yes that is she s not exactly married either not as we understand it you see it s like this he stopped abruptly i am sorry to have been so long said the baron s voice and selden looked up to find him and the prince smiling down at them at least the baron was smiling most urbanely but it was difficult to tell whether it was good humour or suppressed chagrin that parted the prince s lips you have amused each other i hope oh yes said selden we have been having a most interesting time good and the baron sank down again into his chair and polished his glass thoughtfully it is disgusting but even here affairs of state sometimes intrude the prince had resumed his seat against the wall and looked moodily at the champagne bottle it was empty selden caught the eye of the attentive waiter who nodded and hurried away he felt that he was upon the threshold of a most interesting disclosure which a little more wine might precipitate to be married and at the same time not to be married he was conscious that his objection to champagne confidences had considerably diminished besides he wanted an excuse to stay awhile longer but a sudden silence had fallen upon davis he evidently felt himself back again in the infant class and he glanced at the baron from time to time with a certain uneasiness as a bad boy might glance at his master the prince was also silent staring fixedly at the table in front of him his lips pursed his brows contracted in a frown as for the baron he was puffing thoughtfully at a cigarette his eyes on the ceiling immersed perhaps in those affairs of state of which he had spoken so they remained until the waiter brought the new bottle and filled fresh glasses the stimulant seemed to nerve the prince to do something he did not in the least want to do he produced a bulky envelope from his pocket and handed it to davis i am very happy he said to be able to repay you davis took the envelope evidently astonished and glanced at the figures written upon it but look here he protested i don t want this i don t need it i d rather you kept it impossible said the prince it is a debt of honour i might not again be in position to repay it oh all right if you look at it that way said davis sulkily and started to cram the envelope into his pocket you find the amount correct i trust put in the baron smoothly davis glanced at the envelope again as a matter of fact i think it s too much he said but you have kept a memorandum yes since the prince insisted and he drew a little memorandum book from his pocket selden could scarcely repress a smile there is nothing more characteristic of the confirmed borrower than insistence on keeping meticulous accounts to enter the amount in a book is almost like placing it in a bank it proves how conscientious one is please check it over suggested the baron davis did so it s just as i thought he said you ve given me ten thousand francs too much the prince got out his own memorandum book monogrammed in gold on the back turned over the pages till he found the right one and compared the accounts ah see he said you forgot to make this entry on the sixteenth ten thousand francs please make it now said the baron and mark the amount paid after verifying the sum in the envelope davis his face redder than ever made the entry then broke open the envelope and drew out a packet of thousand franc notes at least fifty or sixty of them ran through them with shaking fingers nodded stuffed them into his pocket and wrote paid in large letters across the memorandum it would be as well to add the date said the baron davis complied impatiently and returned the book to his pocket i hope you are satisfied he said the baron nodded good naturedly and lighted another cigarette yes you are very good to humour me perhaps i may seem bourgeois he went on to selden but it annoys me to have debts of that sort hanging over us for they are the most embarrassing of all i know that many people call us adventurers robbers and other hard names they say we never pay our debts it is a lie i admit he added with a smile that sometimes our money does not hold out and our creditors have to wait but they expect that and place it in the bill in the end they are always paid he paused and glanced at his watch one o clock i must be getting back to nice you will come with me my prince no said the prince i will return later with m davis but i want to try my luck first said davis and rose to his feet evidently glad of an excuse to get away i also have an inspiration i hope it may be a good one said danilo and rose too i will come with you and see good night m selden i hope to meet you again you ll be sure to hear from my sister said davis and the two hurried away like boys released from school the baron watched them with a look between a smile and a frown then he settled back into his chair apparently in no hurry to start for home is it that you know the sister of m davis he asked casually no not at all but he says his sister has been reading those articles of mine which annoyed you so much and was interested in them though i can t imagine why ah yes said the baron thoughtfully well it is true as it happens i know the sister of m davis and have even discussed those articles with her she is a most intelligent young lady and she was deeply impressed by your point of view but why on earth should she be interested ah that said the baron with a shrug americans are interested in so many things believe me m selden i am quite sincere in saying that i found your articles admirable it is true they annoyed me the more so because i found them so good but you took m jeneski s theories too much for granted he is an able man yes but he is also an idealist he does not see the practical difficulties in the way of carrying out his programme perhaps they are not so serious as you think suggested selden eh bien let us look at them for a moment in the first place you as an american are prepossessed in favour of a republic is it not so i suppose so the word means so much to you that sometimes you mistake the word for the thing it signifies in my country they have as yet only the word jeneski supported by the army sets up a government and calls it a republic that is all it is not in any sense a republic it is a military despotism they are going to have elections next month selden pointed out but how many people will vote at those elections very few outside the capital even they will be intimidated by the army and will be afraid to vote except for the government for do not forget that not only does the army vote but it will be in control of the polling places if all the people had the opportunity to vote without being terrorized or intimidated and were given a free choice between jeneski and the king do you know whom they would choose they would choose the king very possibly selden admitted they have all heard of the king and very few have heard of jeneski fewer still have any idea as yet of what a republic means no and they will never have said the baron because it is not possible to give them a real republic they must first be educated they must be taught how to govern themselves and it will be impossible to teach them because they will need all their efforts to keep themselves from starving well they must take the chance said selden even if it requires generations as i see it the one outstanding result of the war is the triumph of democracy if the people of europe lose that they have lost everything as long as they hold on to it no matter at what sacrifice the war is worth all it cost them but democracy does not necessarily mean a republic that is a thing which americans find very difficult to understand there is england for example there is holland belgium norway sweden they are not republics but they are none the less democracies more truly so in some respects perhaps even than your own i too recognize the triumph of democracy and i rejoice in it but that does not mean that we must place the government of the country in the hands of a mob quite the contrary there is no despotism worse than mob despotism nothing further removed from the spirit of democracy when i speak of restoration he went on when i work for it as i am working now i do not mean the restoration of old autocracies of outworn rights and privileges i mean the restoration of order and enlightened government a government must above all things have intelligence jeneski has intelligence selden pointed out but he has no resources a government must also have resources well selden began and hesitated i know what is in your mind said lappo quickly you are thinking that neither has the king any resources that is true for the moment and as long as it is true he will not seek to go back but if resources accrue to him as they perhaps may i say to you that jeneski will be committing a crime against his country if he continues to oppose him he paused and glanced mechanically at his watch come he said starting to his feet i must be going pardon me for talking so much at such an hour but it is a thing very near to my heart i have been deeply interested selden hastened to assure him i am most anxious for you to meet the king he is not at all what people suppose him he is but you shall see for yourself ah they never quit gambling in this place he added as they passed through the door into the outer room the wheels were still turning without interruption the crowd was greater than ever but neither davis nor danilo was in sight selden suspected that they were in the inner sanctum dedicated to baccara and he rather expected the baron to look them up but that worthy seemed to have dismissed them from his mind you shall hear from me soon he said and held out his hand i am going too said selden resolutely beating back the desire to stay to get another glimpse of that clever unusual face and together he and the baron went down the stair and got their coats i am arranging a small dinner for to morrow evening said the baron suddenly as they stood on the steps outside waiting for his car if you are free i should be very pleased to have you join us thank you i shall be glad to good i will let you know the time and place till to morrow then and the baron stepped into his car with a wave of the hand selden stood for a moment looking after it as it sped down the slope toward the condamine then he turned the other way toward his hotel a strange man the baron more royalist than the king more concerned for the prince than the prince was for himself a courtier to the bone a man who knew the secrets of every court the skeletons in every closet and most probably not without skeletons in his own well there were few closets without a skeleton of some sort what selden wondered was the skeleton in the closet of the countess remond that grim tragedy in the wood behind bouresches and what game was the baron playing working for a restoration yes but why had he compelled the prince to return those many thousands of francs to davis in so summary a fashion most extraordinary that as though he were trying to impress some one with his probity davis perhaps but why should he care to impress davis who after all was davis and who was madame ghita pondering these and other questions selden mounted to his room and went to bed he could find an answer to none of them but he had a sense of pleasurable excitement for he felt that in some strange way he had been drawn into an extraordinary drama and its most interesting personage was undoubtedly madame ghita the road to eze monte carlo like all other pleasure resorts has its inexorable routine and the feature of the morning is a walk upon the terrace this is followed by an aperitif and half an hour of gossip under a sun shade in front of the cafe de paris these two items occupying the time pleasantly until lunch when the day really commences the terrace pedestrians begin to gather about eleven o clock reach their densest an hour later and then gradually thin away to sit during that hour on one of the benches which face the walk is a rare privilege for the human stream is of never ceasing interest there is the nouveau riche and his family not yet accustomed to the wealth the war showered upon them ill at ease in their new clothes glancing apprehensively at every one as though expecting an accusation there is the prognathous englishman masking his mental vacuity with an air of aloofness but alert to salute every one he considers his social equal there are old roues of every nationality hair plastered down if there is any left moustaches waxed to a point great pouches under the eyes ogling the women especially the very young ones and turning around for another look at their legs and the motion of their hips there is the stream of semi paralytics neurasthenics and debile generally flowing ceaselessly in and out of the hydropathic establishment at the end of the terrace seeking relief from the results of unimaginable forms of debauchery there are fat turks and lithe greeks who glare at each other tall russians and little italians who fraternize as well as a scattering of all the nationalities scarcely yet knowing their own names created since the war over the breadth of central europe and then there are the women the women who are the raison d etre for monte carlo and all resorts like it it is to see the women to permit them to exhibit themselves that this morning parade takes place it is to please the women the chefs in the great hotels labour it is for them the orchestras play it is to them the little expensive shops cater it is for them the casino operates and they are at their best these women on the terrace in the morning the old ones are still in bed the ugly ones shun the merciless morning light only the young and beautiful venture to sally forth and some of them are superb there are celebrities too of a sort and decorations of every degree from the grand rosette of the legion down to the humble poireau there are grey bearded academicians monocled diplomats pallid artists heavy sterned generals portly financiers there is the gargantuan mccormack his hat pulled down over his eyes his lithe little wife trotting beside him there is the sallow venizelos not yet recovered from the shock of defeat in close confab with some other exile there is the talented but enslaved chalmino with his ridiculous fat mistress there is marlborough and his next duchess there is suzanne fresh from her victories at la festa and twittering like a sparrow to two tall worshippers in flannels there is chevrillet the great journalist whose passion for play destroys him these and a hundred others like them pass and repass watch for a time the stupid slaughter of pigeons going ceaselessly forward on the semi circle of lawn down near the water and finally fade away among this throng selden presently appeared in obedience to a command of the countess remond delivered to him that morning with his breakfast i am in the mood for walking she had written please wait for me on the terrace so since he had made up his mind to see the adventure through here he was walking up and down looking at the crowd and breathing deep draughts of the wonderful air it was one of those exquisite mornings bright and yet soft which make the riviera the most favoured of winter resorts the air was full of ozone there was a tang in it which gave a fillip to the blood the sea was of a deep and lustrous blue defying description flecked here and there with whitecaps and dotted with the sails of a flotilla of little sloops engaged in a race on the landward side steep slopes clad with vine and olive and dotted with white villas rose up and up until they culminated with a mighty rush in the rocky summit of the tete de chien two thousand feet above a fairy land a land of wonder and delight selden turned from this loveliness and looked again with a feeling of disgust at the people loitering past was it for this crowd of parasites and voluptuaries that this superb corner of the world had been created he had asked himself the same question once before as he sat in the dining saloon of a great new ship homeward bound from europe was it merely to minister to the pleasures of that crowd and other crowds like it that men had laboured and sweated and died in the fabrication of that marvellous boat what mockery what waste no wonder socialists see red and then he had remembered the hundreds in the steerage to them the ship was an ark a sanctuary it was bearing them to the land of freedom but here there was no such saving purpose it was all mean all sordid compact of vanity and greed and sensuality then suddenly his eyes saw the face they had been searching for almost without his knowledge the arresting and clever face of madame ghita she at least had no reason to fear the light nor had the glowing young cicette who chattered beside her madame ghita was listening and smiling as though to a child oblivious of the glances she attracted with that air of supreme poise which selden had noted and admired the night before would she see him he wondered his heart accelerating its beat yes she saw him her eyes rested in his for an instant and she gave him a gracious little nod of the head as she passed he was unreasonably elated yet why shouldn t she nod monte carlo was not a formal place besides he had been of some little assistance to her the night before in interpreting her to davis it was almost an invitation should he turn and intercept her and then he caught himself up grimly really he told himself he was behaving like a boy of twenty rather than like an experienced and somewhat disillusioned man of thirty four what could madame ghita ever be to him nothing of course just the same he would like to know her no harm in that she looked stimulating perhaps she would pass again he turned at the end of the terrace to find himself face to face with the countess remond how you walk she gasped like the wind and how people have stared to see me pursuing you they must think me very fortunate ah well yes she smiled but had you quite forgotten me forgotten you my dear countess then you must have been composing a new article to stalk along like that with your head down looking neither to the right nor left no said selden as he fell into step beside her i was reflecting how ironical it is that the most beautiful spot on earth should be what you see but it is always like that she pointed out not only the pleasantest places but the nicest things belong to the people who least deserve them you should write an article about it selden laughed grimly that was a savage thrust what do you mean don t you suppose i know how futile it is writing articles is it futile she asked innocently the most futile thing on earth i ought to know i ve been doing it all my life and it makes me sick to think of it but don t talk about it don t spoil this beautiful morning how can we enjoy it best suppose you suggest something she said looking at him from under lowered lashes you said you were in the mood for walking did you mean just walking here on the terrace not in the least i meant walking over the eternal hills see i am dressed for it and she held out for his inspection a slender foot shod sensibly at least not too foolishly and i may have how much time until five o clock smiled the countess selden was conscious that madame ghita and her companion had turned at the other end of the terrace and were coming back but he kept his attention riveted on his companion even to his own ironic amusement simulated an ardour he did not feel and which caused her to rest curious eyes upon him splendid he cried then here is the programme we will go up to la turbie have lunch walk along the grande corniche to eze do you know eze no is it a town yes a gem and we will sit there and look at it and at the world stretched out beneath us and when we are quite ready a car will bring us back will that suit you it will be lovely and she permitted her eyes to caress him the merest bit but i would point out that it is i who am taking your time not you mine if you have something else to do nonsense selden broke in i may be an american but i don t work all the time come along as they turned toward the steps a bulky male figure suddenly loomed in front of them oh how do you do said the countess and then selden saw that the man with whom she was shaking hands was john halsey who had been paris correspondent of the london journal from time immemorial do you know mr selden mr halsey selden echoed halsey who up to that moment had not looked at him oh hello selden i thought you were somewhere in the balkans he did not offer to shake hands and there was something faintly hostile in his air no i m here said selden briefly wondering if it could be possible that halsey was jealous or if it was just his british manner but halsey had already turned back to the countess i have been looking for you everywhere he said i got in just a few minutes ago and they told me at the hotel that you had gone out i want you to come to lunch with me we must have a talk there was something in his air at the same time threatening and cringing like a tiger conscious of his strength but chilled to the bone at sight of the trainer s whip i am sorry said the countess but i have an engagement who with mr selden and i are going to lunch at la turbie she explained sweetly but there was a dangerous gleam in her eye halsey started to say something but saw the gleam and checked himself dinner then he asked no i am engaged for dinner also but i shall be back at five call me up and she nodded curtly and turned definitely away selden glancing back as they mounted the steps together saw that halsey was still standing there hat in hand staring after them with a look anything but pleasant yes the fool must be jealous but even then he had no right to speak to the countess so rudely however he wasn t going to waste any time over halsey and he put him definitely out of his mind he stopped a second at the hotel to order a car sent on to eze and ten minutes later they were in the funicular and its little engine was puffing and panting as it pushed them steeply upward toward la turbie with monaco and the serrated coast opening out superbly below the carriage was filled with tweed dad english on their way to the golf course on mont agel and the feminine members of the party regarded selden and his companion with evident distrust as of another world while the men seemed loftily unaware of their existence it always amused selden this barrier with which the average englishman tries to surround himself in public and he watched now with a smile as the party like a herd of deer scenting danger drew together into a compact mass and hastily got the barrier into place as he glanced at his companion he saw that she was smiling too though it might have been with pleasure at the magnificent panorama opening below them upon which her eyes were fixed for the first time that morning he had the chance to take a really good look at her she had no reason to fear the light though there was nothing girlish about her indeed she looked a little older than she had the night before thirty perhaps every line of her face bespoke the mature woman of the world but the flesh was smooth and firm the eyes unshadowed the lips fresh and rounding upward a little at the corners it was not so arresting as when he had first seen it that quality had perhaps been due to art but it was still unusual with a suggestion of the unplumbed and unfamiliar of age old jealousies and intrigues and ambitions it had race as distinguished from ancestry in fact selden doubted if there was any ancestry that was one of the things she would tell him for he was determined now that he would have her story and not only her own but lappo s and danilo s he knew exactly where he was going to take her to unfold it and exactly what he was going to say she felt his eyes upon her face and glanced at him and smiled and looked away again and presently the engine shrieked and panted to a stop and they clambered out sixteen hundred feet below them monaco lay glittering in the sun while to right and left stretched the indented coast from the chersonese beyond beaulieu to bordighera and the italian hills with the blue blue sea mounting to an horizon which seemed grey by contrast a panorama which perhaps is equalled nowhere on earth it still lay below them as they sat at lunch on the terrace of the hotel and talked by tacit consent of indifferent things and presently he had bought her an iron tipped cane and they were setting forth through the little town la turbie is one of those old old villages built ages ago along this coast high in the mountain fastnesses for safety from the barbary corsairs and the miscellaneous pirates who roamed up and down the mediterranean raiding and sacking and seeking what they might devour it was captured by the romans two thousand years ago and is overshadowed by the ruins of a great stone tower which augustus set up to commemorate the victory its narrow streets and dingy rubble houses have come unchanged through the ages and are still inhabited by the descendants of the old tribes the romans conquered following the same trades in the same way and living the same lives except that now they must dodge the motor cars which flash ceaselessly through the town along the grande corniche strangest contrast of the ages the silken jewelled femme du monde who glances out carelessly at the rough clad red faced girl pushing a barrow of manure to the fields and what thought stirs the girl s brain as she gazes after the vanishing car perhaps no thought at all said the countess when selden put this question to her do not make the mistake of endowing the peasantry with your own mentality as so many reformers do i don t and i m not a reformer he protested just the same i suppose they have some feelings their feelings are centred in their stomachs give them a full stomach and they are happy you talk like baron lappo do i well the baron is a very clever man and he understands the peasantry nine tenths of the people of his country are peasants americans cannot understand them because america has no peasants and so you credit them with noble aspirations patriotism liberty whereas all they really seek is enough to eat i suppose said selden that you are referring to those articles of mine which annoyed the baron yes i am i think them altogether mistaken i admire your optimism but it carries you too far selden glanced at her curiously he was surprised that she should speak so earnestly according to your idea he said the best government is the one which gives its people the most to eat for the least return in labour yes you put it very well that is it exactly how can one believe anything else selden turned the idea over in his head the best government undoubtedly he agreed is the one that gives every man a square deal yes and that is where the old despotisms failed they exploited the people for their own benefit it is where every government fails the people are always exploited for somebody s benefit at least they have swept away the despotisms not one is left standing in the length and breadth of europe that is why i think europe war torn bankrupt disordered as she is is still better off to day than she has ever been because for the first time in history her people are free but they are not free protested the countess impatiently they are still slaves to their stomachs more than ever indeed since food is more difficult to get it is absurd to call them free what is freedom worth to a starving man he prefers food and he must always have a master at least he can choose his master but not at all the peasant can never choose his master do you imagine the russian peasants chose lenin no of course not or that the peasants of my own country chose jeneski there was something in her voice a strange vibrancy as she uttered the name which made him look at her she was gazing straight ahead her nostrils distended with passion her lips quivering and then suddenly her face changed and she threw up her hand with a little cry ah look there they had come to a turn in the road that marvellous road so wide so perfect hung miraculously against the mountain side one of napoleon s masterpieces and below them lay the village of eze unaltered since the dark ages its founders whoever they were must have had the fear of pirates driven deep into their souls perhaps they came from a town which had been stormed and looted and were resolved to run no risk the second time so they had chosen for their new abode the top of a precipitous pinnacle unapproachable on any side save one and almost unapproachable on that with unimaginable labour they had contrived a village there half dug from the rock half built of the rock fragments at the extreme summit they had reared a great citadel as a last refuge if the town was stormed and around the whole they had flung a heavy wall pierced by a single gate flanked with defending towers so well they built so solidly that the town still stands as it has stood for twenty centuries the wonder of the twentieth only the citadel no longer needed with the passing of the sea robber has fallen into ruin and been despoiled for the repair of the other houses selden and the countess stood spellbound gazing down upon it and upon the marvellous background against which it is silhouetted a background of hill and water and curving coast then by a common impulse they turned into a by path and started to clamber down toward it through the vineyards and olive groves past little houses to the highway the lower corniche which runs at the foot of the summit upon which eze stands then up again along a steep and narrow road through the gateway past the frowning walls around the little church and between the dismal houses leaning precariously forward above the steep and narrow passages which serve as streets passages redolent of the middle ages reeking still with the bloody deeds of roman and lombard sicilian and saracen guelph and ghibelline for each in turn held eze and made of it the foulest den of thieves in europe a haven for the scoundrels of every land up and up they scrambled selden and the countess pausing now for breath now to look at a traceried window where once perhaps beatrix of savoy had leaned to toss a flower to her sweet troubadour blacasette up and up until they came out upon what had been the floor of the donjon but was now a wide platform open to the sky and as they looked around it seemed that the whole world lay at their feet at one side of the platform facing the sea stood a rude bench let us sit down said selden then got out his pipe filled it deliberately lighted it and took a long puff now he added i am ready for the story the countess in action for a moment the countess remond did not speak and selden could see that her thoughts were turned inward as though seeking some starting point some end to get hold of in the unravelling of a tangled web he did not suspect that realizing her moment was at hand she was gathering her forces to meet it and casting a final glance over her plan of campaign why did you send for me last night he prompted i wanted to thank you yes but there was something else i was going to implore your assistance in saving a people s freedom she answered smiling as if at her own impulsiveness and you no longer need it i no longer believe their freedom is in danger you are speaking of your own people of course yes you mean then that this new plot of lappo s whatever it is will come to nothing on the contrary he will succeed and the country will be better off he told you last night what his plans are yes some of them he expects of course to put the king back of course it is difficult to take the king seriously said selden he has always been a sort of comic opera king posing as the primitive chieftain of a splendid primitive race perhaps it was not a pose the countess suggested perhaps not but one can t help suspecting a man with such a genius for publicity and he was not always primitive he was the cleverest intriguer in europe even in the war he tried to be on both sides at once because he wanted to save his country how can one serve a little country like that except by intrigue selden took a few reflective puffs well i don t know he said at last i ve never met him so perhaps i m prejudiced but i do know this while he was on the throne the country was absolutely his to do as he pleased with he was good natured democratic interested in his people even jeneski admits that but he had his evil moments when frightful injustices were done anybody who disagreed with him was exiled but the principal vice of the whole system was that the people had no voice in their government how much voice have they now inquired the countess not much i grant you because they re too ignorant but as they grow more fit they ll take a larger and larger part perhaps if they do not starve meanwhile anyway added selden it isn t merely a question of the old king nobody would object if he could gather up a few millions somewhere and go back and spend them on his country but he won t live long and then it will be a question of danilo what about him is he the sort of man to save a country from starvation he would have lappo pointed out the countess it s a shame mused selden that lappo can t work with jeneski what a team that would make but he cannot said the countess he would consider himself a traitor selden nodded yes i know the two fell silent gazing thoughtfully out over the sea you have told me nothing about yourself he said at last do you want to know and she cast him a quick glance i can t help wondering about that man you discovered signalling to the germans selden nodded without looking at her that man was lappo s son said the countess selden stared lappo s son the son of a woman he loved very much he had made a state marriage a very unhappy one and had a legitimate son so he could not acknowledge the other but he got for him a little estate and the courtesy title of count remond afterwards he had reason to be glad he had not acknowledged him for remond s mother died and he developed a streak of madness became involved in frightful scandals and was finally sent to america practically all our people in america had settled in one place at a little town in montana where there was a great copper mine remond came there we met each other and were married he was not without fascination of a sort and i was very young then came the war and remond was soon travelling about the country in what he told me was the allies secret service i saw him very little when america entered the war he enlisted i was very proud of him i never suspected what he was really doing until i heard but how could you hear asked selden it was a military secret the baron found out he had sources of information then he knows that you were the one who denounced remond but of course selden involuntarily glanced behind him oh do not fear said the countess with a smile he is glad the traitor was caught so soon he may even speak to you about it yes that would be like the baron here then was one of the skeletons concealed in his private closet selden wondered how many more there were well he said at last and afterwards afterwards the countess paused an instant afterwards the baron was very kind to me he sent me money he invited me to place myself under his protection but he himself was soon an exile for the austrians overran the country and he had time to think only of his king so it was not until jeneski came back that i could return you came with jeneski asked selden curiously wondering what the baron had thought of that the countess nodded her lip caught between her teeth he and my father had been dear friends she explained when my father died jeneski in a way adopted me so he took me back with him and succeeded in having my little estate restored to me a very seductive adopted daughter selden thought a rather disturbing one the countess s story had rung true up to this point but here it was not quite convincing the estate it is an attractive one i hope he queried it is not bad but i could not stay there the note of passion was in her voice again and her hands were clenched it was impossible i could not do it so i came away to paris to monte carlo to amuse myself to forget one can amuse oneself better here that is true selden agreed searching for a clue to her emotion but weren t you interested in seeing how jeneski s experiment works out jeneski she repeated hoarsely ah you do not know him he is not a man he is a machine which crushes people who get in his way he she stopped abruptly struggling for self control yes said selden i suppose all fanatics are more or less like that i have known some who were human said the countess more quietly and closed her lips tightly as though determined to say no more selden could only ponder what she meant how had she got in his way what had he done to her to him jeneski had seemed very human possessed by his idea of course ready to make for it any sacrifice but full of fire of sympathy of understanding full of passion too unless his full red lips belied him however the countess was saying we need not concern ourselves about jeneski he will soon be replaced i am not so sure of it baron lappo is sure of it i do not think you understand mr selden what an extraordinary man the baron is nothing is concealed from him he is in his way a great artist i hope to know him better selden observed and the king he is not at all what you think but you will see yes the baron has promised to arrange an interview it will be to night the baron is giving a dinner how did you know asked selden looking at her in some astonishment i am to be there you also are invited are you not yes well you can make your observations i advise you to keep your eyes very wide open selden rubbed a reflective hand across his forehead i confess he said that these intrigues are too subtle for my intelligence i don t seem to be able to find the key however i shall do my best i don t suppose you can tell me any more only in confidence you would not want that no agreed selden slowly i wouldn t want that i must be free to use whatever i find out if i think it necessary i understand and you are right she nodded and glanced at her watch come we must be going this dinner is a most important one for me i must dress for it carefully do you know who will be there the king danilo lappo yourself myself and two or three other women madame ghita perhaps hazarded selden and watched her face she could not suppress a little start you know madame ghita she was enquiring for the prince at the sporting club last night i happened to hear her ah said the countess then of course you can guess who she is yes i suppose so said selden slowly with a little sinking of the heart he had hoped against hope that there might be some other explanation ah well if she were danilo s mistress that ended it the countess was looking at him curiously then you knew perfectly well that she will not be at the dinner to night were you setting a trap of some sort no but i wondered who she was i wasn t sure well you are now she said and held out her hand to him and he helped her down the rocky descent to the town she permitted herself to lean against him once or twice but he was too preoccupied to notice madame ghita the mistress of the prince the countess looked at him occasionally trying to read his thoughts but she did not speak again until they were seated in the motor car which was awaiting them you saw the prince last night she asked yes i went over to the sporting club after i finished my work the prince was playing and losing of course no he was winning heavily he must have won two hundred thousand francs was he alone no there was a young fellow named davis with him an american yes obviously so it was from him he got the money she murmured half to herself i suppose so laughed selden do you know him no i have never met him he is very young and callow but i fancy he will get plenty of experience before long first from the prince and then from a girl who has him in her net did the baron see him oh yes he seemed to know him quite well and he was very much annoyed was he not selden looked at her how did you know that oh i guessed it but please go on and tell me what happened the principal thing that happened said selden laughing a little at the recollection was that the baron made the prince repay the money he had borrowed a considerable sum the prince was very much annoyed he would be nodded the countess he has always found more amusing uses for his money than paying his debts with it it must have been a new experience but in this case it was necessary she added thoughtfully i am glad you understand it so well said selden drily the countess laughed and tapped his hand playfully do not be cross she said you will find it much more amusing to piece together the puzzle for yourself and i am sure you will find the key at the dinner to night i am not cross i am only wondering if i shall see you to morrow she glanced at him from under lowered lashes if you wish she said softly he moved a little nearer to her since madame ghita was unattainable and this amusement offered when will you be free he asked all day shall we say dinner then at ciro s that will be lovely thank you said selden you are being very nice to me ah i have a good heart she laughed and perhaps i have some secret reason they were speeding down the slope into the condamine when another motor panted past them so rapidly that selden caught but a glimpse of its occupant but his companion s eyes had been quicker did you see who that was she asked no it was madame ghita and this is the road to nice what of it but it is at nice the dinner is to take place cried the countess surely you are not so stupid as you seem selden could only look at her and suddenly the car jerked to a stop we have arrived she said till to night and thank you for a delightful afternoon and she ran quickly up the steps into the hotel a king s apologia selden dressed for dinner that evening with the same sense of nervous tension that he used to feel in the old days when tumbling out of bed and hustling into his clothes in the middle of the night to witness the jump off of a big offensive he had found a note from the baron awaiting him naming 8 30 as the hour and the villa gloria on the promenade des anglais as the place and expressing great pleasure that selden was to be among the guests its perfect wording awakened in selden fresh admiration for the supreme finish of the old diplomat who was never at fault for the right word the right look the right gesture and presently alone in a compartment of the express which hurtled through innumerable tunnels towards nice he had settled himself in a corner and endeavoured to draw such deductions as were possible from his afternoon s conversation with the countess and to decide how much of it was grist for his mill there was a plot it seemed to get the old king back on the throne but that was nothing new there had always been such a plot ever since the day when the king and his family and a few adherents had been forced to flee the country a plot was taken so much for granted and seemed so certain to prove futile that nobody gave it a second thought hitherto it had gathered to a head whenever the king was in extraordinary need of funds and had faded away again as soon as the funds were secured from some too credulous speculator but this time it seemed to be unusually serious and involved so the baron had hinted not only the restoration of the king but the financing of the country heaven knows it needed financing and no doubt the baron was right the king would be welcomed back with open arms if only he brought some money with him there was no doubt that he had won an immense personal popularity during his half century of power most of his subjects had never known any other ruler and probably desired no other he had mixed with them as a father with his children an old world father to be sure whose word was law he had become a court of last resort to which his subjects were forever appealing to settle their disputes especially their domestic disputes a court the more highly esteemed because no fees were exacted though the gift of a lamb or a dozen chickens or a crock of butter was always appreciated he had lived in a state of patriarchal simplicity carefully contrived and adroitly advertised so that the peasant woman baked her bread with the pleasant consciousness that the queen baked hers also and when some shopkeeper or petty farmer compared the time with the king in the public square of the capital he saw that the king s watch was of brass like his own when he went to the bank to make a little deposit he was as likely as not to encounter the king there also putting aside a portion of his savings moreover this far seeing monarch had not relied on popular prestige alone but had further strengthened his position by marrying his ten children into most of the courts of europe for his eldest son he had chosen a hohenzollern princess his eldest daughter was now queen of a dominion far larger than her father s two other daughters had captured russian grand dukes and a strange turn of fortune combined with a bloody tragedy had brought a grandson to a throne so if any king could be safe he had seemed to be and yet all these safeguards had been swept away by the world war the passion for democracy which emerged from it had decreed that kings must go and pietro had found himself cast aside with all the others but a revulsion had already begun the feeling was growing that an ordered government however despotic was better than a disordered one however ideal in theory and kings and princes exiled in switzerland or holland or along the riviera were beginning to pick up heart of hope and gather their partisans about them yet selden told himself sitting there and turning all this over in his mind despite the fact that this revulsion was being sedulously fostered by financiers and aristocrats and every one else who had been despoiled of money or power by the new order there was not the slightest hope for any of them except perhaps for this one canny old patriarch certainly there was no hope for the pompous coward at doorn or the perjured neurasthenic at lucerne but for this old autocrat well perhaps if he could get hold of enough money to organize an opposition and carry on a campaign no doubt many of his mountaineers thought he was still ruling over them the train creaked to a stop under the great glass roofed shed at nice and selden clambered down to the platform and made his way through the exit to the street he saw that it was only a minute or two past eight so he drew his coat about him and started to walk for the first time since the outbreak of the war nice was experiencing a really prosperous season and it had gone to the head of that mercurial city the newly named avenue des victoires hummed with traffic the side walks were crowded with chattering people happy again in having a host of strangers to despoil the gorgeous shops on either side were a blaze of light with their choicest wares displayed in their windows they were devoted almost entirely to articles de luxe and they seemed to selden as he glanced into them more luxurious and far more expensive than ever where the money came from no one knew but vaster sums than ever before were being frittered away on articles of vanity and personal adornment the wealth of the world seemed to have passed suddenly into the hands of women who were flinging it recklessly to right and left the season at deauville had been marked by an extravagance wild beyond parallel by such gambling as the world had never seen now it was here along the riviera that the orgy was continued and not here only as he well knew but in paris london brussels berlin yes even in vienna and budapest and warsaw before the eyes of starving spectators the dance whirled on thoughtful men looked on aghast but no one was wise enough to foretell how or when it would end that the end would be disaster selden did not for a moment doubt he even looked forward to it with a certain pleasure the crowds in the street had delayed him a little so at the place massena he called a cab and gave the driver the address in a moment they were clattering along the promenade des anglais before a row of stately white villas and great hotels looking out across the wide cement promenade upon the magic sea which stretched away to the horizon the villa gloria proved to be one of the most imposing of these edifices with entrance barred by high iron gates which were passed only after selden had given his name and it had been duly checked upon a list in the hands of the concierge who took a good look at him evidently suspicious of any one arriving in a public cab the establishment was plainly an elaborate one maintained so gossip said from the private purse of the daughter who still retained a throne his hat and coat were taken from him by a bearded functionary in the native costume which to american eyes savours so much of the bull ring and another led the way up a wide stair opened a door and announced him the room he entered was evidently the salon but it was deserted except for the baron lappo who was hastening forward across its empty spaces selden rather taken aback wondered uneasily if he could have mistaken the hour but if he had there was no sign of it in the baron s greeting it is a great pleasure to see you again he was saying i have spoken of you to the king and he is most desirous of meeting you i shall take you to him at once selden murmured his thanks and followed the baron down the length of the long room to a door at the other end the baron knocked and a voice bidding him enter opened the door and motioned selden to precede him stepping through selden found himself in a little room blue with tobacco smoke which was evidently the king s work cabinet an imposing figure was seated at a desk near the window and a secretary with a sheaf of papers was just making his escape through an opposite door lappo led him forward this is m selden your majesty he said the figure at the desk rose to its feet an impressive height i am glad to meet you sir said the king in excellent english i have heard much of you and congratulate you upon your brilliant achievements selden considerably abashed by this greeting had the impression that he was shaking hands with an institution rather than with a man the institution of royalty he murmured something and sat down in obedience to the king s gesture the king also reseated himself his chair creaking loudly but the baron remained standing selden had seen a good many kings in the course of his career but none who looked the part as this one did the tall and dignified king of the belgians was the closest second but he lacked the picturesqueness the air of mastery and profundity which marked this old man he sat there as though he ruled the world he imposed himself he wore as always the costume of his country rich and colourful with embroidery and for head covering a flat round brimless cap of blood red satin with his arms in gold upon the front it became oddly his dark semi oriental countenance with its hawk nose its grizzled moustache drooping on either side the full lips and its deeply cleft chin but it was the eyes which impressed selden most they were very dark and very large and had a peculiar cast or lack of focus which gave them the effect of looking not at one but into and through one and out on the other side distinctly disconcerting until one grew used to it indeed just at first selden had the impression that the king was gazing fixedly at some one behind him i hope you will not mind went on the king if i speak in french i speak english it is true and i have insisted that all of my children should learn that language though i regret to say that some of them forgot as they forgot other of my teachings after they left my house but i have not in it the precision which i have in french it astonishes me sir that you speak english so well said selden i found very few people in the balkans who could speak it at all unless they had lived in america ah monsieur said the king a little sadly when one s kingdom is so small that from its centre one can see almost to its borders and when beyond those borders are age old enemies searching ceaselessly for an avenue of attack one must take care to neglect nothing as you perhaps know i have had six daughters and four sons yes i believe in large families he added with a smile i once had a most interesting discussion upon that subject with your great roosevelt we found ourselves in entire accord i wish i could have married one of my girls to one of his boys it would have been for the good of the race selden nodded his agreement yes that would have been a new strain he was more and more fascinated by this astonishing old man but what i wished to say went on the king was this that since my kingdom was such a small one small you understand monsieur in size but very great in spirit in tradition and in pride it was necessary that i strengthen myself wherever possible by alliances so my children were taught many languages english among them and since i could not permit them to be wiser than their father i was forced to learn them too though of course i learned them much less readily but the effort they cost me has been many times repaid by the ability they gave me to converse with men of many nations whose minds would otherwise have remained closed to me and to read many things of which otherwise i should have been ignorant your interesting articles upon my country for example and upon austria and central europe in general i congratulate you again upon them their point of view is not always mine but i can see that they have been based upon an accuracy of observation and breadth of sympathy altogether unusual will you have a cigarette no tobacco is my one dissipation i am getting too old for any other he took a fat turkish cigarette from a case on his desk lighted it carefully and blew an immense gust of smoke toward the ceiling when my good lappo told me this morning of having met you yesterday he went on and suggested that you be asked this evening half an hour in advance of the other guests i thought it a most happy idea lappo has many happy ideas with a smile at the baron i should be lost without him having read your articles i welcomed the opportunity to explain to you something of my point of view it is no secret that i am trying to regain my kingdom of which i have been unjustly deprived i shall continue to try until i succeed or until i die it is a point of honour with me but i infer from your articles that you would not be sympathetic toward such a restoration it seems to me sir selden answered that the republican form of government is best for any people because it opens the way for opportunity and self development and i do not believe in the hereditary right to rule to dispose of people s lives and fortunes and to control their happiness i do not see said the king that the hereditary right to rule differs in principle from the hereditary right to property because this right is sometimes abused i do not suppose that you would abolish it altogether no said selden i have not yet got quite as far as communism but i think hereditary fortunes all wealth indeed should be limited and controlled so should the hereditary right to rule be limited and controlled as it is in england perhaps ah i can see what you are thinking added the king with a smile you are thinking that deposed monarchs are always democrats that i am a new convert to this idea but there you are wrong i gave my people a constitution long ago it was not as liberal as england s true but one cannot scale a mountain at a single bound one must climb step by step even republics are not always perfect oh they never are selden agreed they sometimes do disgraceful things unaccountable things ours has in turning its back on europe but however ignorant and selfish they may appear they are nevertheless a step forward toward the liberation of mankind perhaps so but i repeat that it may sometimes be too long a step to take safely all at once my argument monsieur is this one cannot suddenly give complete liberty to a people who for centuries have been accustomed to guidance and control without running the risk of very grave disaster civilization is the result of people working together of a vast co ordination when government fails and the people fall apart into little groups each working for itself civilization fails too rather than take such a risk the wise man proceeds slowly and with caution he seeks to lead the people upward gradually a small step at a time that is true sir agreed selden the trouble is that in the past they have often not been led upward at all but kept ground down in the mud at the bottom of the pit by the fear and the greed of their rulers if they have progressed it has been in spite of their rulers in the past perhaps not in the future that day monsieur will never return the war has liberated the world from slavery to old forms and old ideas i believe so with all my heart said selden our task is to keep it from sliding back again but the war was not able to make men wise all at once said the king so we must also take care not to become the slaves of new ideas which are worse than the old ones or which are really only the old ones cleverly disguised with a new name there will always be in the world monsieur men who seek wealth and power for unscrupulous and selfish ends as i look about me at the present state of europe i fear sometimes that it is falling into the hands of such men i fear there was a tap at the door the king glanced at a little clock on his desk the other guests are arriving he said and rose i have enjoyed our talk very much m selden and especially your frankness we must continue it sometime meanwhile i confide you to the good lappo and he bowed with the most engaging cordiality the bomb bursts selden was conscious of a distinct liking and admiration for the old monarch as he watched him hasten forward to meet the new arrivals two women and a man it is m davis with his mother and his sister explained the baron who had remained behind a moment until the king s greetings were over selden saw with some astonishment that it was indeed the same young davis whom he had met at the sporting club the night before why should the king invite these americans to dinner and especially why should he welcome them so warmly with such graciousness combined with patriarchal dignity why should he pat miss davis s hand as though he were her father what was the meaning of the baron s faultless deference who were these davises anyway these questions flashed through his head in the moment during which the king bent over the hands of the ladies and inquired solicitously about their health then it was the baron s turn and then davis turned and saw selden why hello he said and came over and shook hands sis will be tickled to death to see you yes said the king whom nothing escaped and who had evidently been coached by his good lappo i felt certain that miss davis would be glad to meet so distinguished a countryman and you also madame and he brought selden forward and introduced him the elder woman surveyed him through her lorgnette evidently wondering who he was and her greeting was perfunctory in the extreme but when he shook hands with her daughter he found himself looking into a pair of eyes fairly dancing with excitement yes indeed she said i am glad to meet you your articles seem to me perfectly wonderful i have read them all that is a great compliment said selden laughing a little at her enthusiasm i doubt if there is any one else who has read them all you are interested in politics then oh there was much more than politics but i liked them especially because they were so so brave so optimistic the baron had drawn near and was listening smilingly too much so perhaps said selden with a glance at him that at least is the opinion of m le baron no no you do me wrong protested the baron i think merely that there is a safer road up the mountain than the one you indicate at least up the mountains of my country which is very mountainous indeed and perhaps you are right m le baron agreed selden amiably miss davis had been listening with an intensity which puzzled him i want to be quite sure that i understand she said m le baron and i have talked a great deal about your point of view his idea is that the old regime could do much more for his country than is possible under the new one if the old regime adopted some new ideas and could arrange to finance the country he is probably right selden conceded ah mademoiselle you see cried the baron obviously elated it is as i told you but come the king has something to say to you what the king had to say seemed of a semi confidential not to say romantic nature at least miss davis laughed and blushed and shook her head left to himself for a moment selden had an opportunity to examine the two women as for the mother her origin character and ambitions were written large all over her in her plump face with its insignificant features and bright little eyes like a bird s in the figure too fat too tightly corseted in the voice too loud and not quite sure of its grammar in the gown too elaborate and the jewels too abundant a woman who had once no doubt been a good sort with a certain dignity and genuineness but who had been spoiled by prosperity and also perhaps by a careless and too indulgent husband an american husband selden could see him in company with countless others labouring away at home to make the money which his wife and family were frittering away on the pleasure grounds of europe the boy was curiously like her but the daughter was of a different and much finer type and selden guessed that she carried on the father s strain not strikingly beautiful but fresh skinned and wholesome with a face delicately chiselled and touched just the slightest when in repose by sadness or disillusion just a little too old and too reserved for its years in this respect more of europe than of america perhaps it was the mother who had disillusioned her but why should the king listen to them both with such attention why should the baron be so deferential could it be possible that these people had something to do with the plot the baron seeing selden standing alone managed to guide him back to mrs davis whose cool greeting he had noted and for which he proceeded at once to atone it is not often we have with us a man of such wide influence as m selden he began the baron exaggerates selden hastened to assure her i am just a newspaper man mrs davis oh said mrs davis using her lorgnette again her experiences with newspaper men had not always been fortunate and she distrusted them but a newspaper man as you call it the most distinguished the baron persisted perhaps you have heard your daughter and myself discussing some of his theories perhaps i have she agreed uncertainly m selden is a democrat the most pronounced went on the baron no whit discouraged but we are trying to convince him that a monarchy also may have its virtues i am sure there is little to be said for democracies said mrs davis severely as one lecturing a small child when one sees their horrible blunders and such men they do blunder selden agreed but at least it is their own blunders they suffer from so there is a sort of poetic justice in it no it is other people who suffer said mrs davis they rob every one when i think that my income tax this year she was interrupted by the announcement of the countess remond and was instantly so absorbed in contemplation of that unusual woman that she quite forgot to go on the countess remond had said that she was going to dress with care but selden had foreseen no such finished perfection and moreover it was at once apparent that she was as much at home in a king s drawing room as in any other nothing could have been more correct more perfect than the way she acknowledged the introduction to the king which the baron made the king himself regarded her with an appreciative eye for he had always been a connoisseur of women holding her hand the tiniest fraction of a second longer than was necessary and took advantage of the moment when the baron was continuing the introductions to motion the major domo to him and give him some brief instructions in an undertone as that solemn functionary bowed and hastened away selden guessed that the king had suddenly decided upon a rearrangement of the places at table the way in which the countess greeted the ladies was also a work of art it was so charming so cordial so gracious without a trace of that arrogance which alas too often marks the bearing of ladies of the old world toward ladies of the new and which indeed one might well expect of a countess her indifference to the men was almost as marked she acknowledged their presence with the coolest of nods and turned back at once to the women as far more interesting the elder flattered almost inarticulate was already at her feet and the younger was visibly impressed the countess was confiding to them something about her gown the clumsiness of maids selden noted the satisfied smile which the baron could not wholly repress the energetic way in which he polished his glass evidently the countess was playing the game whatever the game might be very much to his liking i have heard so much of you and of your daughter from my old friend baron lappo the countess continued to the enraptured mrs davis speaking with a pronounced and very taking accent which selden had not heretofore noted in her speech permit me to say that your daughter is lovely the true queenly type mrs davis sputtered her delight her daughter blushed crimson selden gaped a little at the adjective queenly now what did she mean by that and looking at the countess more closely he saw that in some way she had subtly altered her appearance her face seemed longer her eyes had a little slant her lips were not so full i see you are not accustomed to such frankness she rattled on but i am frank or nothing if i think nice things about people i believe in saying them yes even to their faces ugly ones also sometimes but you talk almost like an american cried mrs davis it was in america i learned my english the countess explained i was there with my parents as a girl at washington mrs davis had a vision of the countess s father as a great diplomat but selden had another start she had not mentioned washington to him that afternoon she had spoken only of montana miss davis had been looking at the countess intently with startled eyes as though striving to recall some memory i should be so glad to talk to you about it added the countess she had noticed the girl s intent look and turned full face to her so that she got all the benefit of the slanting eyes and the thin arched brows perhaps you will have tea with me you must have tea with us cried mrs davis to morrow if you wish assented the countess with a gracious smile which included the younger woman meanwhile the king and the baron had been consulting together in undertones from their aspect it was evident that something had gone amiss i was forced to send danilo on an important errand this afternoon said the king finally and he has not yet returned he has had an accident perhaps oh i hope not cried mrs davis that would be too terrible if any one was injured said the king with a smile it was undoubtedly some one else in which case he would be detained only until he had satisfied the police but i do not think we shall wait any longer baron will you summon the princess anna the baron disappeared and presently returned with a tall young lady on his arm she was perhaps twenty five very dark with a perceptible moustache and very thin this is my youngest daughter anna said the king named as all my daughters were for one of the great saints of my country the princess anna bowed to the guests without taking her hand from the baron s arm she at least seemed to have no reason to ingratiate herself with the rich americans the king nodded and the doors at the end of the room swung back disclosing the gleaming table beyond may i have the honour madame and he offered his arm to mrs davis selden permitted young davis to take the countess and followed with the sister were you really in earnest a moment ago she inquired in a low voice in earnest yes in saying the baron might be right why yes entirely so he answered puzzled by the intensity of her look she took a deep breath and turned her head away for an instant and then they were at the table when they were seated he found himself still at her right beyond her was a vacant place evidently for danilo while beyond that and to the right of the king sat the countess selden smiled to find his surmise correct even at eighty the king had not lost interest in pretty women mrs davis was at the king s left while beyond her the baron the princess anna and young davis who had been adroitly detached from the countess completed the company the king with patriarchal dignity asked grace in his native tongue somewhat to the confusion of his guests selden could see mrs davis regarding with a startled eye the red cap which the king made no motion to remove then came the soup and she was startled again to see the princess anna rise and serve her father in our country the king explained with a smile seeing her glance it is the custom for the daughters to serve their parents i consider it a very good custom and my daughters have always followed it as you know he went on tasting the soup with an approving smack of the lips i have a daughter who is a queen but when she comes to visit her father she still gives him to eat the picture of a queen ladling out the soup was too much for mrs davis and she gasped audibly or perhaps it was the soup which she at that moment tasted the king had brought his native chef with him from goritza and this soupe a l oignon was one of his masterpieces but it was rather a shock to the unaccustomed palate especially if the cheese was a little strong but since it came from a royal kitchen mrs davis battled with it manfully the king asked for a second serving it was at that moment the prince appeared selden was sure he had never looked more handsome his eyes were shining his dark skin usually a little sallow was most becomingly flushed he seemed in the gayest possible mood even a reckless mood no do not rise said the king to his guests motioned the prince to his side and put to him a stern question in his native tongue the prince replied expansively for an instant a scowl of displeasure threatened the king s countenance then he smiled blandly round upon the company it was as i thought he said fortunately no one was killed make your apologies sir to the ladies the prince with a mocking light in his eyes bent over mrs davis and raised her plump hand to his lips it was really impatience to be with you madame which caused the accident he said gaily a speed too swift a road slippery from the rain oh what a fib broke in the lady tapping him playfully with her lorgnette but never for an instant did she suspect how great a fib it was the prince made his other greetings swiftly then dropped into the seat beside miss davis kissed her fingers as he had her mother s and spoke a low sentence into her ear and selden noting the quick flush which swept across her cheek noting the baron s attentive eyes noting the king s benignant good humour understood in that instant the whole plot for a flash his eyes met those of the countess remond who was smiling cynically maliciously as though at some long cherished vengeance about to be accomplished then he turned back to his plate his heart hot with resentment it was horrible that a girl like that should be sacrificed to the ambitions of a worldly mother no wonder she was disillusioned and to a libertine like the prince of that of course she could have no suspicion and she would find it out too late of happiness there was not the slightest possibility yet was there not he looked again at myra davis there was something in her face that said she was not a fool that she had had some experience of the world so she must know something of the ways of princes and it would be exciting to be the wife of a man like that to be compelled to hold one s place against all the other women and he would teach her many things of love as the average american understood it mutual trust mutual respect common interests fidelity placid affection nothing at all but there would be bursts of passion shattering experiences and if she were strong enough to survive being cast down from the heights from time to time she might win through might in the end even hold him at least she might find such a life more interesting than the placidity of the meadows there was always that choice in life between emotion and tranquillity and selden had never been able to make up his mind which was the wiser to be a queen even an unhappy one even of a tiny kingdom but what of madame ghita did she know of this was that why they had met her driving toward nice did she intend to interfere and was it conceivable that any man would leave a woman like that probably the prince had no intention of leaving her and again selden glowed with indignation but he was conscious deep down in his heart that his indignation was not so much for the girl at his side as for that other woman about to be deserted or worse still compelled to share he awoke abruptly to the knowledge that miss davis was addressing him you have been there quite recently have you not mr selden oh yes he answered guessing instinctively where she meant only a couple of months ago are the people happy yes in a way of course life is very hard among those bleak mountains but then it has always been they are used to it it is more hard than ever now is it not put in the baron from across the table it is harder than ever all over europe said selden this generation will never know the old ease that is true agreed the baron yet with proper guidance some nations will emerge more quickly than others what our little country needs is first of all a firm and experienced hand at the helm and secondly capital to revive its industries repeople its pastures and fertilize its fields with those it will be the first nation in europe to find its feet again undoubtedly said selden but where is the capital to come from do you really think he is right asked myra davis in a low voice selden was conscious that the eyes of the whole table were on them and that the whole table was waiting for his answer yes i really believe so he said and that the people would be happier she persisted then he understood here at least was one of the forces urging her forward but it would take millions she should understand that yes he said slowly with a strange sense of responsibility they would be stronger perhaps if compelled to work out their own destinies but not happier certainly they would be glad to have the way cleared for them but to do it effectively would take a large sum a very large sum many millions there was no secret about it any longer they were all sitting there waiting for her decision and mademoiselle pursued the baron our little kingdom would be like home to you since you have already lived so long among our people selden looked the question he scarcely felt at liberty to utter nearly all of our people who went to america settled in one place explained the baron in the town founded by the father of mademoiselle and named after him there they assisted the development of an enormous property a mountain of copper a great light burst upon selden so it was that davis the copper king well there would be millions enough but those were the people who had come back from america to make their own country a republic also jeneski had told him the story it was their labour which had amassed those millions which were to be used to rivet back upon them the chains they had broken he did not know whether to laugh or weep at the savage irony of it the king had bent over toward mrs davis and asked her a swift question his face purple with excitement she had glanced toward her daughter and a long look had passed between them selden could see the baron s mesmeric gaze upon the girl she looked down she looked up then her cheeks went crimson and she nodded her head the king with beaming face signed to the attendants to fill the glasses mesdames et messieurs he said rising glass in hand i have in my life which has been a long one had many happy moments but none so happy as this when it is my privilege to announce the betrothal of my grandson and successor prince danilo and the fair young lady who sits beside him let us drink to their happiness and to that of my beloved country he drained his glass sent it crashing over his shoulder trundled around the table caught the girl in his arms and kissed her resoundingly upon each cheek my dear he said the young rascal shall make you happy i promise it otherwise i will disinherit him and you shall reign alone selden makes his choice it was difficult to quiet down after that and go on with the dinner the whole house was buzzing with the great news and selden was sure that champagne was being consumed even more liberally below stairs than above probably the king knew it too but for once he did not care looking at him sitting there triumphant and benignant selden was reminded of nothing so much as of some biblical patriarch abraham perhaps certainly at this moment the king s bosom seemed wide enough to contain the whole world he was ready to forgive all his enemies the baron fairly scintillated for this was his great hour of triumph even the dark immobile face of the princess anna was illumined as by some inward light she had come around the table and kissed the bride to be solemnly on the forehead as though consecrating her to a sacred cause mrs davis was radiant and more inarticulate than ever which was of small importance since nobody listened to her here was the greatest marriage which any american family had ever achieved there had been dukes and counts perhaps an earl or two and in one case the brother of a king also deposed but never before a crown prince her daughter would be the first american girl to sit upon a throne no wonder she was overcome a little hysterical very warm with excitement and champagne dabbing her eyes now and then and looking altogether ridiculous she had never really believed it would happen myra was such a strange girl yet here it was and she had a vision of myra sitting on her throne with an ermine robe and crown of diamonds very regal and she herself considerably thinner than in life standing a little to one side but very near also with ermine and brilliants and diplomats and statesmen in white satin knee breeches coming up to be presented as she had seen them in a picture of one of queen victoria s receptions and the crowd bowing very happy and loyal the countess remond was also deeply moved though in a dark and threatening way that puzzled selden her eyes were gleaming exultantly her lips were drawn back in a smile that was almost a snarl as she bent her gaze upon myra davis and a spasm of nervous emotion ran across her face from time to time in spite of her efforts to repress it there was something bloodthirsty and wolf like about her which gave selden a little shiver of repulsion for he felt that he was looking at the real woman with all her veils torn aside and it seemed almost indecent she had the veils up in a moment and was again the calm and smiling woman of the world but selden never forgot the shock of that moment s revelation and any feeling of tenderness he may have had for her died then and there he felt only that she was a woman to be watched and to be feared young davis had gone suddenly morose but that may have been because of his high alcoholic content and the look he bent upon his sister had something ironic and mocking in it as though he alone understood her and found her far from admirable few girls however are altogether admirable to their brothers of the whole company the affianced pair were by far the most composed the prince had indeed kissed the girl s hand at the end of the king s speech but his demonstration had ended there as for myra davis except that her eyes were larger and darker than usual there was no outward evidence that she was in any way excited selden wondered where she had gained such self control the dinner came to an end at last the bride to be was carried away by the other women danilo bowing over her hand at the door and the men were left together to discuss the great event it was the king who opened the discussion i trust that you are pleased m selden he said i was hoping that the announcement might be made to night but i was not sure i am very happy that you were present if i am not mistaken put in the baron m selden himself had something to do with bringing about the decision perhaps so said selden i had no suspicion what it was leading to but i only said what i thought you said it admirably commented the baron but i confess selden continued that i am astonished you should care so much for my opinion after all what does it matter the baron glanced at the king who nodded i have been expecting that question said the baron and i am going to answer it frankly we have nothing to conceal therefore let us place all the cards on the table it is then not yet entirely clear ahead to restore the dynasty yes that will not be difficult but to win the approval of the public opinion of the world that will not be so easy this is a day when republics however inefficient are in favour and when kings however enlightened are looked at askance there was a time when public opinion outside of one s own country could be disregarded but that is so no longer there is the league of nations to which jeneski sends a delegate there is the supreme council claiming wide powers as the organ of public opinion we have witnessed recently the spectacle of a king called back to his country by a majority of his people and yet likely at any time to lose his throne a second time because the public opinion of the world is against him and no important country will recognize him we wish to avoid that mistake selden nodded it was his own opinion that constantine would find it very difficult to cling to his throne that our country will be vastly benefited by this restoration i do not for a moment doubt went on the baron you have yourself perceived how deeply this great opportunity appeals to miss davis nevertheless we shall have to maintain our position at first against great prejudice it will be said at once that we have bought our way back to power our enemies will dig up old scandals and invent new ones there will be a bitter campaign against us well we want you on our side wait he added as selden made a gesture of negation hear me out what we are asking you to do is this to observe us to question us to dissect our motives and to report faithfully what you see and learn to be present at the restoration and to examine our conduct we do not fear public opinion monsieur if it is correctly informed i am sure that we may count upon you to do so much why yes said selden of course i shall be glad to do that i should have done that anyway only only you must be free to say what you wish but certainly what we hope is to convince you and through you the world especially england and america america will have a deep interest in this restoration there has never before been an american queen we have a convention that they are all queens laughed selden but of course there will be tremendous interest in a real one may i begin asking questions at once please ask as many as you wish how do you propose to accomplish this restoration not by force i hope certainly not we shall first approach jeneski and his ministers lay before them our plans for the country and invite them to withdraw i am hoping that they will do so after all jeneski is a patriot but should they still foolishly persist the assembly is to be elected in march we will carry the elections and the new assembly will recall the king you will bribe the electors not at all we will explain to them as we did to jeneski and his ministers our plans for the development and enrichment of the country we will organize our friends and spend some money in propaganda yes but that is legitimate even in america i understand yes said selden nobody can object to that do not forget m selden as i have already pointed out to you that the king is very popular with his people he could have appealed to them before this with every hope of success but before he did so he wished to be in position to assure their future you are sure that miss davis will wish to use her millions in this way but yes have you not yourself seen it she is on fire at the great opportunity such as comes to very few women and there is a certain justice it seems to me in the fact that the millions wrung from that mountain of copper by the labour of our young men are to be used for the succour and rejuvenation of their country that is one way of regarding it certainly selden conceded he glanced at young davis who more morose than ever was tracing patterns with his glass on the cloth had he no interest in his sister s future well there was one question which must be asked and he himself would ask it what about miss davis herself her happiness her well being is she going to be just a tool in your hands davis looked up his eyes a little bloodshot an ironical smile upon his lips as though wondering how selden could be so silly i thank you for that question sir put in the king with the utmost earnestness as for miss davis i charge myself with her she shall be my daughter have no fear i was entirely serious in what i said just now about the succession i shall have the necessary papers executed and passed by the assembly so that in case of my death my wishes can be carried out if there is need danilo shrugged his shoulders after all he seemed to say there were many places in the world more amusing than his bleak little capital and there was madame ghita the king regarded him sombrely young people to day are lacking in reverence he said speaking in french they have no sense of responsibility it was not so in my time i had only nineteen years when my uncle died danilo after whom this young man is named and i was proclaimed prince it was not until fifty years later that the powers accorded me the title of king during all that time i had laboured ceaselessly i had driven pestilence and famine from my country i had organized an army and defeated the turk i had founded a system of education which still remains the best in the balkans i had granted my people a constitution and an assembly and was leading them along the path of self government then the war came and without hesitation i chose the side of the entente against the turk and the prussian my little country was seized and overrun my army was captured everything seemed lost but in my exile i waited patiently certain that my allies would win and would restore me to my throne that would seem to be simple justice would it not monsieur selden nodded undoubtedly there was a good deal to be said on the king s side and the king was an excellent advocate i was aware went on the king with dignity that certain old enemies of mine were seeking to defame me but i despised them it is true that my eldest son had married a german woman but that was nearly forty years ago it is true that another son took refuge in vienna and fought with the austrians but it was not with my consent there was nothing i could do it is a lie that my army surrendered unnecessarily it was on the verge of starvation it is a lie that i intrigued against my allies nevertheless there were some who believed these lies his eyes were flashing and he was pounding the table with his fist what happened sir at the end selden asked i have heard many stories i should like to know the true one and you shall sir said the king i want the world to know it this is what happened when we entered the war some hundreds of our people who had lived in america returned to fight for their country that was their duty nevertheless i salute them for coming back many had gone to america because they had some grievance against me it is impossible to please every one and over there those grievances had magnified also some of our young men had gone to vienna or to belgrade to study and had brought back with them ideas so dangerous that we were compelled to forbid them the country these also for the most part had gone to america and among them there had grown up a sentiment of revolution they even sent back from time to time an emissary to assassinate me i did not mind that the king added with a smile it rendered life less dull but it enraged my people the baron nodded solemnly there were two attempts he said it was not a thing to jest about ah well said the king with a wave of his hand all that was long ago but these men came back we could not inquire then as to their sentiments the times were desperate we had need of all of them but they brought their ideas into the army and after the surrender during the long months in the prison camps of austria they had the opportunity to propagate their poison it spread everywhere then came the end austria withdrew her troops for a last stand against italy was defeated and surrendered i was already back in my capital with lappo here striving to restore order when the prison camps were opened and the army came streaming back jeneski who had been waiting for that moment met them at the frontier called together a number of his partisans declared for a republic and marched against me i had no forces to oppose him and again was driven into exile in spite of my representations he persuaded the conference at paris to confirm this so called republic but he was ill at ease he knew that i had still some power and he offered me a huge sum if i would abdicate i refused a king cannot abdicate only cowards abdicate and i would not further impoverish my country no monsieur i am still king majesty it was a word befitting that memorable figure which had been buffeted by the storms of eighty years and was still unconquered there was something epic about it homeric so that one forgot its follies and its sins and remembered only its gallantry yes and my grandson shall be king after me he went on with an irate eye upon danilo and after him my great grandson whether they reign or not that is in the hands of providence but they shall be kings none the less for kingship is not a thing that one can lay down at will it is something that one is born as one is born a man it is one s blood a certain anxiety might have been discerned in the attentive lappo s eye he knew his king he knew the smallest corner of his mind and he feared perhaps that he might become too expansive with the warmth of the wine might go on to divine right and heaven sent prerogative at any rate he coughed rather markedly and the king who also knew his lappo understood he emptied his glass and rose it is time we joined the ladies he said one moment sir interjected selden i realize that i am a guest here to night i appreciate very deeply the confidence you have shown me and the candour with which you have spoken i ask you therefore how much of this you would wish me to use why all of it my friend cried the king how little you understand me all of it thank you sir said selden and glanced at his watch in that case i must be making my adieux certainly said the king but i count upon seeing you soon again you wish to speak to me he added to danilo for the prince who had grown more and more distrait during this apologia had risen and come close to his side he spoke for a moment earnestly in the king s ear and again selden saw overspreading the royal features the same cloud he had noticed once before that evening nevertheless the king listened patiently until the prince had finished then with an impatient shake of the head waved him away come messieurs he said and led the way into the salon there was an ugly look in the prince s eyes the baron stepped to his side and fell behind with him talking earnestly the ladies were seated before a wood fire crackling pleasantly on a wide hearth and it was at once evident that the countess remond was not only the centre of the scene but completely dominated it mrs davis and her daughter sat close on either side of her and the princess anna her dark face unusually animated bent above an embroidery frame near by and they were talking very very confidentially the king paused for an instant on the threshold to contemplate this picture so delightful and domestic and then as its occupants started to their feet came forward with a benignant smile no no do not rise he said and himself sat down in a great chair which had been placed for him at a corner of the fireplace how many old scenes this brings back to me evenings of long ago you remember anna when we sat together around the fire my family and i we were very much out of the world you understand mesdames there in that bleak corner of the earth but at least we could have books and the critiques from paris and our own lessons in the languages i even wrote a poem now and then yes and a play which was pronounced not too bad celebrating one or another of our great patriots and martyrs for even a small people m selden may have its great legends which reminds me that i must not detain you m selden he added to the company goes to announce to the world the memorable event which has taken place here to night selden s eyes were on myra davis he knew she would look at him and he wanted to see that look but when it came it told him nothing already it appeared she was learning to wear the mask which all queens must wear so he made his adieux quickly only when he came to the countess she held his hand close for an instant and give him a long look as though seeking to read his mind but he was sure that she had not succeeded the baron detaching himself from the prince accompanied him to the door i shall not see you for a few days he said it is necessary that i go to paris at once to arrange certain matters as soon as i return i will let you know i shall then be able to tell you more about our plans you are giving me a great scoop selden pointed out an exclusive piece of news he added as the baron stared if you wish that i should share it with others the baron stopped him with a gesture no no no he protested we wish it to be yours only we shall be very happy if you can win some glory out of it it will make certain chancelleries sit up hein this news shall i call a car for you no thank you said selden i prefer to walk and left him chuckling on the steps the great gates were clanged open for him and he passed through into the promenade des anglais the night was soft and warm with the rising moon painting a path of silver across the sea and all the world was out to drink its beauty he would have to go to the main postoffice to get his wire off promptly and he walked on as rapidly as the crowd permitted yes the baron was right this news would upset some of the chancelleries especially those of other little republics delicately balanced not yet sure of existence how would jeneski take it time had not been able to dim the impression left upon him by that vivid enthusiast a dreamer if there ever was one with a haunted look as of a man with something gnawing at his heart yet not entirely a dreamer capable at least of turning into a man of action when some desperate crisis demanded it and of giving and taking hard knocks that hasty meeting at the frontier that declaration of a republic he had been a man of action then and might be again yet even as he talked with him jeneski had seemed too much of another world and that impression was deepened now jeneski s visions were all of toil and conflict of scaling the heights in search of human brotherhood but very few people cared to scale heights by far the most of them preferred to sit quietly at home before a good fire with hands folded complacently over a full belly and that was precisely what the king would offer should he selden help or hinder it was too much perhaps to say that he could stop it but the king was right in thinking that no dynasty could now endure unless the public opinion of the world approved it would be easy to win that approval there was so much to be said on the king s side it was only necessary to take him seriously and yet he was also singularly open to satire and to irony as the viennese had perceived when they built their comic operas about him he could be painted and perhaps with equal justice either as the patriotic and devoted father of his people or as a senile survival of the middle ages with a degenerate grandson for his heir there was the weak spot in his armour his achilles heel danilo with his amours with madame ghita but after all as the king had said danilo could be swept aside would be swept aside if necessary he had the king s word why not for the present at least give the king the benefit of the doubt and this point decided selden felt his special falling into shape in his brain so that when he reached the telegraph office showed his credentials and drew the first form from the box it was ready to his pen half an hour later with a sigh of relief and satisfaction he pushed the last sheet in to the impressed attendant and started to put away his pen then with a little smile he drew out another form and wrote a hasty message i will pay for this one he said and waited until the attendant counted the words this name monsieur suggested the attendant perhaps you would better spell it j e n e s k i said selden jeneski a day s work well it was done selden reflected rather grimly next morning over his coffee a telegram from the foreign editor of the times had been brought him with his breakfast congratulating him warmly on his exclusive story and praying him to follow it up the times for all its drum and trumpet democracy was as he knew quite well aristocratic and capitalistic at heart and so was its american namesake with which his services were shared indeed the latter journal made no especial effort to conceal the fact and so the kind of stuff he had sent in the night before was exceptionally welcome it was a sort of oasis in the desert presently there would be a ponderous editorial to the effect that staunch and sturdy britain with its traditional love of sportsmanship and fair play was prepared to give even kings a chance nevertheless he realized that his judgment had been considerably clouded the night before doubtless on his own quarterdeck even captain kidd might seem a picturesque and downright character who could cite injustices done him and could point to atrocities committed by civilized society far more horrible than any of his own he might even attain a certain merit because of his bold directness his straight speaking his scorn of littleness he was probably fond of children and a sentimentalist at bottom so the king face to face was more impressive than in retrospect yet selden reminded himself there was a lot to be said for him the trouble was that there was so little to be said for his grandson though selden added to himself even here he might be unjust he did not really know danilo one thing in his favour was that he did not pose people could take him or leave him he was not a coward and undoubtedly he had his code many crown princes had sown abundant wild oats and yet made excellent kings but selden knew it was none of these things that really troubled him it was the uneasy feeling that he had been responsible for that quick nod of the head which myra davis had given her mother and that he told himself was something he could not be responsible for not at least until he was sure she understood exactly everything that nod let her in for after that if she wished to keep on nodding it would be nobody s affair but her own therefore it was his duty to see that she did understand he must go to her and tell her tell her very plainly and directly without palliating phrases he squirmed a little at the prospect but there was no other way he could square himself with his conscience she would probably resent it and her mother of course would be vastly outraged but he must risk it he had the feeling that the baron had been a little lacking in candour the night before his opinions had been asked without any hint of their implications yet as he cast his mind back over what he had said he did not see where he would have altered it even if he had known nevertheless it was up to him to enlighten miss davis very thoroughly on the morals and manners of princes he was staring moodily out of the window turning all this over in his mind and keeping resolutely submerged a very very sore spot in his consciousness whose existence he would not even admit when a knock at the door announced a boy with a salver on which lay a tiny note i will be on the terrace at eleven it said and it was signed vera de remond there is no answer he said to the boy tipped him and went back to the window what did he care where the countess would be at eleven he had not forgotten that moment of revelation the night before when she had looked at myra davis like a beast of prey sure of its quarry there had been in her face a kind of gloating as though she were revenging herself in some way upon the girl but that was nonsense yet why had she seemed so triumphant could the quarry be some one else jeneski madame ghita the name was uttered at last he had not been able to keep it back yes there was the sore spot it was for her he was uneasy it was she for whom his heart reproached him it was she whom he wished to protect he suddenly made up his mind that he would see the countess if she really had a secret he would drag it out of her so he arrayed himself rapidly glad to have something definite to do and sallied forth into the bright cool morning he had not noticed the time but as he left the hotel the big clock over the casino entrance told him that he was early so he strolled about the camembert as the little round park just in front of the casino is derisively called and looked at the people and tried to arrange his thoughts the crowd here is astonishingly different from that on the terrace for these are the people who haunt the public rooms derelicts for the most part poised as it were before the mouth of the dragon searching for an inspiration before plunging in to stake their last louis or perhaps with their last louis lost and nothing to do but watch the feverish procession which continually ascends and descends the casino steps and wonder where another louis could be borrowed or begged or stolen it is a motley and sordid crowd lolling on the benches or loitering uncertainly about ridiculous old women wonderfully arrayed in the fabrics of 1860 fondly misinterpreting the astonished glances cast at them frizzled old men struggling to conceal a bankrupt interior behind a pompous front cocottes endeavouring to pretend they are not for everybody and at the same time to appear not too difficult impecunious gamblers trying to pose as men of affairs but always betrayed by a loose end somewhere dowdy old couples to whom the tables have become a habit more devastating than any drug a new comedie humaine waiting for another balzac selden regarding these people for the hundredth time with an appreciative eye wished that he were the balzac and sighing a little because he was not he turned away to the gayer life of the terrace gayer at least on the surface fascinating as a whirlpool is fascinating tempting the onlooker to jump in and be swallowed up and seductive as things dangerous and forbidden have been seductive since the days of eve the countess remond possessed those qualities of fascination and intrigue too superlatively he realized it anew as he saw her coming toward him down the steps her lithe uncorseted body faultlessly clad in a grey tailleur which conventional and subdued as it was seemed somehow exotic as she wore it selden thanked his stars that he had gained immunity the night before by that glimpse he had had of her soul it was very pleasant to know himself out of danger how good of you to come she said as he took her hand and then she looked at him more closely for her instinct felt the change in him are you annoyed at something did it disarrange you to meet me here no not at all i shall keep you but a moment but i felt that i must have a little talk with you before before he prompted as she hesitated before i begin my day s work and since the safest place for a confidential conversation is in the midst of a crowd so we are going to have a confidential conversation queried selden falling into step beside her yes on my part at least like the baron i am going to place all my cards on the table it is what i had been hoping said selden quietly she looked at him quickly smiling a little yes i saw in your eyes last night that you were not pleased with me perhaps i had had too much champagne but i am quite recovered from that so am i said selden grimly in fact i am very sober i have even some twinges of remorse i was afraid you would have that is one reason i wanted to see you we must talk it out yes we must he assented she led the way to a seat at the end of the terrace facing the harbour where they could talk undisturbed now she said why remorse well began selden slowly you know as well as i do that while this flood of american money may be a sort of short cut to prosperity for your little country in the end it will be disastrous for it since it brings the old dynasty back no she said i know nothing of the sort he looked at her what do you mean he asked how long do you think the old king has to live i don t know well not long he has already had two heart attacks ah i see what you mean he murmured and after him the republic again certainly my country would never endure danilo nor permit itself to be governed by an american but in that case he pointed out this whole affair is nothing but a piece of sharp practice against whom against the davises oh she said negligently they deserve it i am not concerned about them but i am he said at least i am concerned for miss davis you need not be she assured him with a flash of the eyes she is by no means the ingenue you seem to suppose she can take care of herself and she can afford to lose a few millions it isn t the money i think the country should have some of it but she ought to know exactly what she is letting herself in for you mean madame ghita yes well why do you not tell her she asked mockingly i ve about made up my mind that i shall have to he said dismally you see i sort of pushed her into it last night she was smiling again as she looked at him and this is the real cause of the remorse i suppose so how did you push her into it i was silly enough to say that i really thought she could do a lot of good out there well do you not believe it of course i believe it but that isn t the question dash it all you know as well as i do what i mean these women are absolutely ignorant of european ideas of the ideas of such fellows as danilo mrs davis poses as worldly wise thoroughly initiated but she is really as ignorant as a child she has heard that men have mistresses that husbands are sometimes unfaithful and so has her daughter i suppose but it is all outside their personal experience it is always some other woman s husband it would never occur to either of them that their own husbands could be or that in this particular instance the husband to be is not only unfaithful now but hasn t the slightest intention of being faithful in the future that he would laugh at such an idea that at this moment he is living here with his mistress but she is not his mistress put in the countess quietly selden halted in mid career could only stare a dozen conjectures flashed through his mind not his mistress he stammered it is madame ghita you are talking about i suppose of course she is his wife she has a right to the name i have even the idea that he is faithful to her his wife selden gasped but married quite regularly in paris morganatically of course i do not know whether you will think that better or worse selden his head in a whirl did not know himself but of one thing he was sure the wrong to madame ghita would be far worse than he had fancied he tried to explain this to the countess who listened with an amused smile you remind me of those silly old knights she said who were always riding out to rescue some damsel without waiting to find out whether she really wanted to be rescued don t worry about madame ghita in the first place she knew perfectly well when she married the prince that he would have to marry again some day for the sake of the dynasty in the second place i suspect that the prince is much more in love with her than she is with him at least the baron tells me that she is an unusually clever woman while as you know the prince is quite stupid so she can hold him if she wants to undoubtedly and if she wants to she will stop at nothing do you know her selden asked no so you don t know whether she will want to no but i am going to find out i have asked her to lunch with me to day that is the first part of my day s work does miss davis know about her not yet at least i do not think so but she is going to know you mean you are going to tell her yes said the countess with a little grimace that is the second part of my day s work i have tea with her and her mother this afternoon selden took off his hat and drew a deep breath of relief then that lets me out he said i think it s rather sporting of you do not idealize me nor my motives protested the countess it is a matter of business lappo asked me to we are going to tell her because she is certain now to learn it anyway and it is far better that she learn it from us than from some malicious newspaper or anonymous letter it will not be difficult as the baron puts it it will be almost as though she were marrying a divorced man that will not shock her so much no i suppose not selden agreed of course you will swing it yes i think so agreed the countess with a little smile but before i started to try to swing it i wanted to have this talk with you so that everything would be quite clear between us i must know where you stand all right cards on the table go ahead and he settled back to listen if miss davis has the situation explained to her so that she knows what she is letting herself in for as you put it and still chooses to go ahead with it you will have no further compunctions on that score i hope certainly not well said the countess quietly i shall be very much surprised if she does not go on with it she is neither a child nor a fool and there is a compelling impulse driving her on yes she sees herself the benefactress of an impoverished people the country will have a new saint said the countess with a mocking little laugh but perhaps there is still another reason you think the prince attracts her oh no though she may get to like him at present he is just a necessary evil since for children there must be a father he has one quality which will appeal to her more and more he knows how to be discreet which reminds me selden remarked that the explosion you expected last night did not take place no the prince prevented it it was that made him late he was with her yes he must have promised her something she knows then of course lappo has already had a talk with her what did she say to him the countess smiled at remembrance of the baron s face i do not know exactly except that she spoke of love ah you see but that does not discourage me went on the countess cheerfully on the contrary women really in love rarely speak of it my own impression is that she is determined to make the best bargain she can and she is right but i shall have it out with her at lunch that is if she comes she has not yet accepted but i think she will if only out of curiosity there may be some fireworks but in the end she will agree i am sure of it agree to what asked selden agree to exchange the prince for the annuity which the king is now for the first time able to offer her selden made a grimace of distaste all this was a little too cynical especially as it touched madame ghita the countess looked at him her eyes sparkling with amusement not entirely free from malice you do not like it no but if she does agree you will have no compunctions about her either no if she really does you do not believe she will she asked looking at him with a gaze suddenly intent as though for the first time she saw something in his face she had not before suspected well come to lunch too and see for yourself selden stared it is my lunch she explained i may ask whom i please you will enjoy it i m not so sure of that besides i shall need your moral support she added laughingly please come will lappo be there no he has gone to paris to arrange the marriage settlement with the davis solicitor there will be just us three if she does not come we shall be tete a tete selden was distinctly conscious that he had no ardour for a tete a tete with the countess remond and though he did his best to keep it out of his face she instantly perceived it how american you are she said looking at him with laughing eyes no i am not offended but do not be afraid she will come but if she resents my presence she will not if she does you can leave before the real discussion begins all right said selden i ll come but i don t promise to give you any moral support you may find me fighting on the other side then i shall be sure to win said the countess and looked at him with a strange smile now i must be going the luncheon is at one in my apartment she glanced at her watch and sprang to her feet in a sudden panic juste ciel i must fly no you are not to come with me i am in earnest please do not he watched her as she hurried away through the crowd and up the steps toward the casino at the top of the steps a burly man was standing as though keeping an appointment his eyes on the entrance to the hotel just across the street the countess approached him swiftly and touched his arm as he started round upon her selden caught a glimpse of his face it was halsey of the journal clearing the ground what could be the connection between halsey and the countess remond selden wondered as he turned away he tried to remember what he knew of halsey but it was not very much they had met casually in paris a number of times and had dinner with him once at the cercle interallie when they happened to be working on the same story but that was all he had never liked halsey s style the journal was a sensational sheet always seeking to play up the scandalous never so happy as when it was able to uncover a dark corner in the life of some public man ever eager to impute unworthy motives to the backers of any cause and halsey rather gave the impression that he liked that sort of thing certainly he was not held in very high esteem by his associates and selden s own idea was that he had lived so long in a cynical circle in paris that he had caught its tone once he got hold of this affair of the prince and myra davis selden very well knew what he would make of it more especially if he discovered the existence of madame ghita but of that he was probably already aware since the marriage had no doubt been played up by him at the time it occurred he wondered if the countess for some reason of her own was keeping halsey informed but she could scarcely do that since halsey s jeers would imperil the whole plan upon which her heart was so evidently set or was she keeping him in order or was he just her lover but selden could not imagine why such a woman as the countess and then all thought of halsey and the countess vanished for he saw approaching the woman whom from the first moment he reached the terrace he had hoped to see the woman about whom his thoughts were centring more and more who in the last half hour had taken on for him a new interest and a new meaning she saw him at the same instant and turned and spoke a word to the man walking beside her and selden looking at him perceived it was young davis completely immersed in miss fayard who walked on his other side and who was certainly not unresponsive in another moment davis was bringing the ladies toward him selden he said i want you to meet madame ghita you remember very well said selden i am happy indeed to meet madame i also she said and gave him her hand with a charming smile but let us speak french to myself i said who can it be that man so distinguished whom i have not seen here before and later i inquired of m davis what he told me made me more than ever curious so when i saw you just now i commanded him to present you that was very nice of you said selden making a mental note of that word later so the prince and davis had kept the appointment as he had supposed they would do her eyes were resting on his with the same frank and unembarrassed questioning he had noticed the first time he saw her as though she were seeking to discover what was passing in his mind what he was pondering about they were a very dark brown those eyes almost black and again he noted the ivory softness of her skin innocent of make up and singularly glowing in spite of her lack of colour this is my niece mlle fayard she added and selden bowed to the young girl you two may walk on and continue your french lesson while i talk to m selden she is teaching me the first conjugation davis explained looking ridiculously happy we have started with aimer allez allez commanded madame laughing at the blush which overspread the girl s cheek with a frenchman i could not do that she added looking after them but with an american yes why is it i don t know said selden but you agree with me that it is quite safe oh yes said selden for the girl that is she laughed outright are you really such a cynic she asked then she grew suddenly serious do not be mistaken about her she is a very good girl believe me i have taken good care of her i can see that said selden and they walked on for a moment in silence are you married she asked suddenly forgive me she added as he stared a little but it is something that a woman always wishes to know about a man i do not think you are but i should like to be sure well i m not said selden a fellow who knocks around the world as i do has no business to be married you travel a great deal i am always looking for trouble whenever there is a row anywhere i pack my bag and start was it for trouble you came to monte carlo oh no said selden i came here to get warm after two months in the balkans also to rest a little and i have had the good fortune to meet here some very interesting people one superlatively so and he made her a little bow thank you but you have not rested i usually find some work to do and then of course there are the tables yes and the women yes they are wonderful aren t they he countered not all of them but the one you were with yesterday seemed to me rather unusual who was she ah that said selden calmly was the countess remond he felt that he had scored although madame ghita certainly did not start but there was a new expression in her eyes she is an old friend of yours she asked no i met her monday evening i have never met her said madame but i am going to have lunch with her to day are you said selden i am very glad so am i this time she did start you are sure it is for to day that you are asked she questioned oh yes she told me that she had invited you but that you had not as yet accepted so you are in the plot too she said slowly and the eyes with which she scanned his face were quite black that is a thing i had not suspected no answered selden quickly i am not in any plot but if i were i should be on your side madame i pray you to believe it she looked at him yet a moment as though striving to read his very inmost thought then she glanced around let us sit down she said and led the way to a bench now you must tell me what you know everything in the first place you know do you not that prince danilo is my husband yes i know that as legally my husband as the woman you marry will be your wife yes except that i have no claim upon his estates or his title and our children if we had any could not succeed to them yes and there was of course the understanding that some day if he wished he would be free to make a marriage of state in order to carry on the title yes well the prince does not wish to marry again if he consents it is only because the king commands it and he conceives it to be his duty to his country i can well believe it madame said selden eh bien i went to nice last night to stop it after all i have some pride some rights i will not be disregarded and cast aside like that i understand said selden you are right do you need my help she looked at him suddenly with curious intentness you are in earnest absolutely she smiled at him almost tenderly i shall not forget that she said perhaps some day i may even call upon you but i did not interfere last night because danilo gave me his word that he would leave the matter in my hands to decide one way or the other before the settlement is signed that was fine of him oh danilo is a gentleman said madame and he will keep his word besides she stopped and shrugged her shoulders but to selden the shrug was more eloquent than words she meant of course that danilo loved her and she did she love him that was the question selden would have liked to ask but he did not dare you have not yet made up your mind he asked instead no she answered slowly looking at him with a queer little smile you see there are so many things to consider of course if danilo refuses the king will cast him off for a time at least and there will be no more money danilo could never earn any and he has borrowed all that is possible so his affection for me would grow less and less day by day for he is like a cat he must be comfortable and at last the day would come when he could endure it no longer and would tell me good bye you are saying nothing of yourself selden pointed out oh i could endure it no more than he laughed his companion less perhaps so it may be the part of wisdom for his sake and for my sake to make the best bargain i can now while there is a chance does that seem very cynical no just sensible but one is not supposed to be sensible in affairs of the heart is it not so well i may not be sensible in this affair i cannot tell but i am willing to listen to what they have to say the countess remond is an emissary from the king is she not yes and she is inviting me to lunch in order to discuss this affair yes i thought so and again she looked at him with her strange little smile what i do not understand is that you also should be there ah madame said selden quickly i pointed out to her that you would not like it i shall not come but i did not say i did not like it on the contrary i wish you to come only if you are an ally of the countess i must be prepared for you i am not an ally of the countess selden protested not in any sense i should like to be your ally madame if you will have me she glanced at him quickly then turned her head away for a moment as though looking for her niece and davis then she looked back at him and her face was very tender of course i will have you she said her voice a little thick selden was deeply moved he looked away out over the sea and for a moment there was silence between them but it was a silence which said many things have you met her she asked at last this miss davis yes does she resemble her brother oh no said selden not in the least she is much stronger and finer you admire her then yes in a way is she fond of danilo no i don t think so not especially then it is just ambition ambition to be a queen her mother is ambitious and of course urges her on but i think what miss davis cares for most is the opportunity to do good with her money no no said madame ghita quickly a man might believe that but not a woman there is something beside that there must be something more personal more passionate i am sure of it if i could only see her well it may be possible why not i would invite her to open her heart to me as i should open mine to her and together we would decide yes yes that would make it easy a donkey engine which had been unloading coal from a steamer beside the quay gave a shrill shriek with its whistle and abruptly stopped there came a tinkle of bells from the ships in the harbour twelve o clock cried madame ghita can it be i must be going where are those children come we must look for them the children were discovered not far away leaning over the balustrade watching a low italian destroyer which was steaming rapidly along the coast and working assiduously at their languages french for davis english for cicette they seemed to be progressing very satisfactorily among the tenses of aimer though cicette found it difficult to get exactly the correct sound of the o in love and davis thought the way she said it much prettier than the right way as indeed on her lips it was madame ghita broke in upon them without compunction come cicette she said bid adieu to the gentlemen we must be going it is very late selden looking at her more carefully than he had taken the trouble to do before found her much less ordinary than she had seemed at first glance her face was yet a girl s but it gave promise of character as well as beauty davis might well do worse but look here davis protested i won t see you again till evening then why can t i take cicette to lunch impossible said madame firmly i have her reputation to consider and she led her charge away the two men watched them as they went up the steps the elder woman so straight so graceful so full of ease the younger fluttering beside her like a butterfly her feet scarce touching the ground it was difficult to realize that the actual difference in their ages was probably not more than five or six years and that the impression of maturity which madame ghita gave was due almost wholly to her finish her ease her perfect poise as they passed from sight davis took off his hat and wiped his forehead and breathed a deep sigh is it as bad as that inquired selden with a smile oh i m in love all right davis answered and i m going to marry her i don t give a damn what anybody says i ve never met a girl who could hold a candle to her look here said selden if you can get your mind off that young woman for a minute or two i d like to talk to you about something else what about this engagement between your sister and danilo well what about it asked davis a little truculently does she know about madame ghita i don t know probably not don t you think she ought to know what for when the prince marries again madame ghita becomes his widow that s all perhaps so assented selden scenting the baron s teaching just the same she ought to know there is a widow it would be squarer oh well i can tell mother said davis i think she already knows well then it s none of my business said davis impatiently and don t you worry about sis she s perfectly able to take care of herself and always has been if you think she would take any advice from her loving brother you re greatly mistaken she looks down upon me as a kind of insect to be pitied but not respected also if she has made up her mind to marry danilo she ll marry him just the same if she knew he had ten widows see here though i ll tell her if you want me to provided you ll do something for me what is it asked selden help me to get mother s consent to marry cicette i m of age and i can marry anybody i want to but dad never had much confidence in me and my money is all tied up so i can t touch it beastly i call it of course i d have enough to live on but if i married cicette i d want to show her the time of her life will you selden looked appraisingly into the pleading face perhaps davis wasn t such a bad sort after all the right kind of wife might make a man of him even a big brother might do something selden had never had a kid brother and the thought rather appealed to him i won t promise he said i want to look you both over a bit more first i haven t spoken two words to cicette and not many more to you davis must have seen a certain sympathy in selden s eyes for he caught his hand and wrung it delightedly all right he shouted i agree the more you see of cicette the more you will like her i m not afraid of that but you ve got to convince mother that she s good enough for me oh i wasn t thinking of that selden retorted the only question in my mind is whether you are good enough for her now i ve got to go and he left davis staring after him in delighted amazement place aux dames selden went up to his room and got ready for lunch with a clearer conscience than he had had since he opened his eyes that morning at last he knew where he was he was definitely aligned not on the king s side or the prince s side or miss davis s side or the countess s side but on madame ghita s side and there he was quite sure he would remain until the end whatever the end might be whatever help he could give her was hers to command not that she seemed to need any help just the same there he was and the consciousness of that fact might be some comfort to her and as the first step he decided to be promptly on time so that madame ghita might find him her ally on the spot when she arrived so at one o clock precisely he was knocking at the door of the countess s suite it was opened by a heavy set woman of middle age slav or italian discretion personified evidently the countess chose her maid not for looks but for qualities more useful and one glance at this woman confirmed him in the opinion that the countess was a born intriguer she took his hat and ushered him into the salon where the countess joined him in a moment i know you will be greatly disappointed she said a little maliciously but it is not to be a tete a tete after all madame ghita is coming you see i was right yes and i feel like the second at a duel selden commented oh do not be alarmed said the countess lightly there will be no bloodshed a few feints at the most then she will surrender what else can she do i am inclined to think she can upset the whole affair if she wants to so don t be too confident and i warn you that my sympathies are entirely on her side i know it said the countess looking at him with a strange little smile that is one reason i wanted you here and before he had a chance to ask her what she meant by that the maid ushered in madame ghita more than ever selden was reminded of the field of honour by the way the two ladies shook hands each measuring the other and he breathed a sigh of relief for it was instantly evident that madame ghita had nothing to fear from her antagonist she was as always calm smiling perfectly at ease while there was in the cheeks of the countess an unwonted flush of colour which betrayed a profound excitement it was too good of you to offer me lunch madame madame ghita was saying i have heard so much of you from the prince my husband certainly selden thought the lady was losing no time for the last words had been flung at the feet of the countess like a gage of battle but the countess chose for the moment to disregard them yes she said sweetly i had the pleasure of meeting monsieur le prince a few nights ago permit me to present to you a friend of mine m selden enchanted said madame it is always a pleasure to meet americans and she gave selden her hand her eyes shining with amusement with a quick little pressure of the fingers which recognized him as an ally with a secret between them the countess had given a signal to her maid who drew apart the curtains before an alcove looking down upon the public gardens and disclosed the waiting table come she said and led the way to it placing selden on her right and madame ghita on her left facing each other across the centre piece of feathery mimosa it is delightful here said madame ghita looking out across the gardens as she drew off her gloves and tucked them back out of the way my apartment is on the other side facing the south with a little too much sun here you have the sun only in the morning are you staying in this hotel also m selden yes madame said selden and my room also faces the south but i do not complain for i cannot soak up sun enough after two months in the balkans you have been in the balkans i have never been there strange is it not when one considers that my husband is prince of a balkan country but he himself has not been there for a long time through no fault of his she added with a smile it appears he will be going back before long remarked the countess she had nodded to the maid who served the hors d oeuvres taking the dishes from a table near the outer door where the waiters left them a discreet arrangement to which she was apparently well accustomed yes i have heard that baron lappo has another plot in hand said madame ghita negligently and glanced at the maid ah you can trust anita said the countess quickly noticing the glance for one thing she is very deaf madame ghita laughed deafness is very convenient sometimes is it not and i can see she is discreet an old family servant perhaps she has been with me for a long time said the countess she has but one fault a weakness for gambling in paris she wastes her last sou on the races here the tables take everything it is a terrible vice agreed madame ghita have you been having good luck m selden really madame said selden i have never played seriously i lack the gambler s instinct when i am winning i never dare to push my good luck far enough and when i am losing i always stop just too soon i always hear my number come as i leave the table to my mind the only way to play is to sit down certain of winning resolved to win or to lose one s last franc in the effort but i have not the temperament i am too cautious yes said madame ghita it is so my husband plays and he always loses his last franc again it seemed to selden that there was a trace of defiance in the way she uttered those words mon mari my husband it was the third time she had used them since she entered the room he does not always lose madame selden corrected i saw him winning the bank s last franc a few nights ago but by this time the bank has them all back again i sometimes think it is even worse for a gambler to win than to lose he is encouraged to go on to commit new follies you should be thankful you have not the temperament m selden and you madame he asked ah i too gamble sometimes it is true not because i have the temperament but because i have great need to distract my thoughts what would you monsieur here am i the wife of a prince but not recognized because i have no money in a position the most equivocal knowing that schemes are constantly afoot to marry him to some other woman is it strange that i become a little mad sometimes and do foolish things i tremble myself at the things i think of doing plan out to the last little detail as i lie awake at night staring at the ceiling i have been to him a faithful wife i have been discreet i have asked nothing i have worked for his interest whenever i could and what is my reward that fat lappo comes to me and insults me surely he did not insult you madame protested the countess is it not an insult to offer a woman a price for her love demanded madame ghita and such a price if it is only a question of price began the countess it is not broke in madame ghita after all i have my pride and i have also perhaps more power than they think but you have always known madame pointed out the countess that some day the prince would marry yes said madame but if i wish i will take him away from his wife on his wedding night as i did on the night of his betrothal and she attacked her salade viciously oh i am not a fool she went on i know what is planned danilo confides in me i know what occurred last night i had made up my mind to prevent it but but your better sense prevailed said the countess you said to yourself since a marriage must take place it may as well be now as any time more especially since now it will give the dynasty its throne again while in another six months it will be too late that makes nothing to me sniffed madame ghita and since it will also give you an annuity went on the countess undisturbed on which you can live in comfort luxury even i warn you that luxury is expensive one can live very well said the countess even in these days on a hundred and fifty thousand francs a year there was a moment s silence selden was deeply moved to see a tear roll slowly down madame ghita s cheek and splash into her plate but there was one tear only she was herself again in a moment come she said i must understand where i am is it lappo who sent you to me yes he asked me to see you since he had failed himself i am afraid i was not very polite to the good lappo admitted madame ghita though i am rather fond of him but i was annoyed that day and it seemed to me that he took things too much for granted as though i had nothing to do but to accept whatever he was pleased to allow me he is in some ways a great man and i think he even has a certain fondness for me but he has told me as much put in the countess but beside this old king of his this dynasty to which he is a slave nothing else matters i am certain he would not hesitate to murder his son to kill his wife if he had one if they stood in its way he is a fanatic on that subject it would be a good thing for him if the dynasty perished there is another thing i do not understand she went on more calmly why is m selden present at this discussion is he a witness selden suddenly crimson started to rise but madame ghita waved him imperatively back into his seat i am not objecting to your presence monsieur she said quickly pray do not take offence but i should like to understand it m selden is not here of his own choice explained the countess he is here because i asked him to come as a witness perhaps but a witness for you madame not for me i do not understand said madame ghita slowly her eyes full upon selden s madame said the countess weighing each word and watching its effect m selden is as perhaps you do not know a very great journalist unfortunately he has always been an admirer of republics but the baron has i think convinced him that in this case the monarchy can do more for our country than is possible for the present republic m selden s support will mean a great deal to the monarchy and the baron has laboured hard to get it but one scruple remained in m selden s mind the fear that you would be wronged too much that you would not be treated fairly so i asked him to be present to day in order that he might see for himself what your feeling is he has warned me more than once that he is here as your ally it was wonderful to see the change which came into madame ghita s eyes as this explanation proceeded the tenderness the happiness of the look she turned on selden and when it was ended she held out her hand to him across the table you will forgive me monsieur she said softly i am very proud to have such an ally and whether he raised her hand to his lips or whether it raised itself he never knew but as he kissed those long delicate fingers he felt them flutter shyly against his mouth like the wing of a bird come said the countess who had lost nothing of all this who had watched it indeed with the satisfaction of a general who sees his plan of battle succeed tell me you accept there is nothing else to be done your good sense tells you so what would you gain by making a scene you might prevent this marriage though even that is by no means certain but would that compensate you for ruining the prince upsetting the dynasty and condemning yourself to a life of poverty there will never again be a chance like this if this is lost all is lost you are still young yes said madame ghita with a little smile so there is no reason why i should lead a life of poverty unless i choose it that is true but accept now and you will have something very few women have independence you will be free to look for love to wait for it for an instant madame ghita s eyes rested pensively upon selden independence yes that is very nice she said but it is a pleasure to be dependent upon a man when one loves him then she looked at the countess curiously i am astonished to find you on this side so eloquent i had always understood that you were jeneski s friend selden knew that the countess flushed though his eyes were on the table but her hand was in the range of his vision and he saw that it was trembling that is long since finished she said a little thickly the baron is a much older friend and i am doing what i think best for my country and for me also asked madame ghita with a strange smile yes for you also can you doubt it again there was a moment s silence then madame ghita looked across at selden come m selden she said since you are my friend and my ally what do you advise ah madame protested selden with a gesture of helplessness how can i advise i do not know what is in your heart but if my heart is not concerned in that case said selden a little coldly i should by all means advise you to accept he was looking at her now at the vivid mobile mouth with its little mysterious smile at the eyes curiously intent as though experience had taught her that she must look into people s minds as they talked in order to get their full meaning and suddenly she burst into a peal of laughter how serious you are she cried and how shocked if by any chance a woman tells the truth come it is settled i accept the prince shall have his little american with her millions the king shall have his throne again lappo shall have his heart s desire and i i shall have a hundred and fifty thousand francs a year and shall be free to look for love so we shall all be happy it is understood of course that the hundred and fifty thousand will be mine to do with as i please but certainly said the countess looking at her curiously there are no restrictions and you madame la comtesse what do you get a new title to serve one s country yes that is very noble men have died for their country but for a woman it is not enough ah said the countess sombrely that is my secret perhaps you will know some day madame ghita looked at her for a moment with that clear and penetrating gaze then she pushed back her chair our business is arranged then she said and i must be going i have a niece to look after i promised her that i would not be long madame i have to thank you for a most delightful luncheon i also began selden but the countess stopped him if you will remain for a moment she said madame ghita flashed an ironic glance into selden s face what she saw there seemed to amuse her au revoir alors she said and in a moment she was gone so you see i was right commented the countess as the door closed behind her yes agreed selden a wry smile upon his lips yes she is as you said a sensible woman every woman in her position has to be sensible the countess pointed out she may treat herself to nerves occasionally but she must never lose her head and she is right absolutely right oh of course she is right agreed selden a little bitterly but sometimes it is better to be wrong gloriously wrong do not misjudge her said the countess quickly she may not be at all sensible in the way you think it was not because of the money she accepted i am sure of it i doubt if she will even use it for herself you heard her stipulate that she might use it as she pleased yes said selden but that would be very ah unusual she is an unusual woman and if she ever loves a man really loves him that man will be very fortunate do you not think so undoubtedly agreed selden trying to speak lightly i only hope she finds the right one so do i said the countess i am sure she will she added with a little smile she was silent for a moment looking at selden s troubled face as though hesitating whether or not to say something more at least she went on at last your compunctions in that direction are at an end yes i suppose so i go to nice this afternoon as you know to see miss davis then my work will be finished you are going away yes i shall not stay here but i shall tell you to night how my mission succeeded to night have you forgotten she asked with a smile that you invited me to dinner pardon me he said confused so much had happened since that invitation was given of course at ciro s she went on yes at ciro s he assented there was an ironic light in her eyes as she looked at him i can see you are not very keen for it she said but i have a very special reason for wishing to dine with you at ciro s to night so you will be good and take me why of course i ll take you he said and registered a mental vow to give her the best dinner ciro s could produce i shall be proud to take you you are very nice you know she said her head a little on one side sometimes i almost regret that you do not care for me but no it is better as it is i am going to see that you are rewarded now do not ask any questions very well said selden i will call for you at nine and he took his leave once in his room he got into robe and slippers filled his pipe and threw himself on the chaise longue he must reason this thing out he must find the key to what was in the minds of these two very subtle women why had the countess looked at him so strangely what was the reward she planned for him and what had madame ghita meant by friend what was it she had said i thought you were jeneski s friend why had that long white hand trembled so the lions roar the london times does not reach nice until five o clock in the evening but by the middle of the morning a crowd of newspaper men diplomats and motley adventurers were besieging the gates of the villa gloria as the baron had foreseen selden s telegram had caused a considerable flutter at many london breakfast tables lord curzon for example who heaven knows is not easily moved from the prearranged and almost godlike tenor of his ways reached his office ten minutes earlier than usual wired paris for a confirmation and called in his balkan expert and his financial adviser for a conference that lasted nearly an hour at the end of which a long telegram of mingled advice and admonition was sent to jeneski and another to the ambassador at paris informing him that the attitude of the british foreign office would be strictly neutral which meant of course that if the king could get back his throne pay off his debts to britain and open up some trade the empire would have every reason to be gratified all the balkan ambassadors proceeded to warm up the wires between london and their several capitals most of them sending selden s article in full in order to avoid the bother of composing something out of their own heads and then repaired to lord curzon s ante chamber to inquire what the british government was going to do about it lord curzon of course hadn t the slightest intention of telling any one what he was going to do about it even if he knew himself but he concealed this fact behind a cryptic manner and a jove like demeanour he gave jeneski s ambassador an extra minute on the strength of which that worthy sent a hopeful telegram to his master but neither of these telegrams reached jeneski nor did the ones from paris brussels and belgrade for by the time they had been relayed through to his capital jeneski had departed nobody knew he had departed except three of his ministers whom he had called together in the early morning to read a telegram which had just arrived from nice the general impression was that he was suffering from a slight cold but as a matter of fact he was in an airplane flying across the adriatic as selden had suspected there was no lack of decision about jeneski in a critical moment but even his ministers wondered what he could hope to accomplish at nice two of them were strongly of the opinion that he should stay at home and begin at once to organize his forces if it got about that he had left the country the effect would be very bad the royalists might even attempt a counter revolution the third one urged him by all means to go but it was in the secret hope that he would fall into the adriatic en route and the way be opened for the king and the millions he would bring with him perhaps jeneski suspected this but he started just the same the stir in london was not only in the diplomatic dovecotes for a number of people of no discoverable occupation either sent urgent telegrams in cipher or else suddenly discovered that they needed a rest on the riviera and booked places on the afternoon boat train and of course the foreign editor of every newspaper wired his nice correspondent or his paris correspondent if he had none at nice an inquiry more or less polite as to how the devil he had come to miss this important piece of news during the day this commotion spread to the continent and from paris rome vienna lucerne hopeful adventurers turned their faces toward nice like vultures gathering for a feast all of them anxious to assist in the restoration of a dynasty so well fortified with real money in the shape of american dollars all of which was brought forcibly to selden s notice about the middle of the afternoon when he was startled out of his thoughts by the ringing of his phone yes what is it he asked allo is this m selden yes allo this is the manager yes what is it allo there are some people here to see you m selden who are they i do not know who they are monsieur said the manager but they say they are journalists and that it is necessary they see you at once i hope there has been no scandal reassure yourself selden laughed cause them to be sent up to my room if you please three minutes later there was a bang on his door which was flung open without further ceremony as he had been so certain it would be that he had not taken the trouble to rise hello he said as they rushed upon him what s the matter with you fellows anyway why hello scott i m mighty glad to see you i didn t know you were down here and he shook hands with paul scott of the daily news the comrade of many a campaign and one of the best informed men on international affairs in europe now what s eating you there were perhaps a dozen men in the crowd and he nodded to the others that he knew you know well enough what s eating us you damn pirate said scott grimly since when have you been the publicity man for that old toreador over at nice i haven t tackled that job yet said selden i m still working for the times then why should he send us all over here to see you did he do that yes he did just that maybe he wanted to get rid of you suggested selden with a chuckle but sit down scott sit down the rest of you if you can find chairs now let s have the story my story said scott taking off his hat and wiping his forehead is simply this i came down here partly to get a rest partly to interview old clemenceau when he gets back from india and i expected to have a few days just to loaf around but this noon i get a telegram from lawson asking if i wake or if i sleep and outlining that beat you put across after i had cooled off a little i put on my hat and hunted up the villa where the king lives there i found these boys kicking their heels outside the gates and discussing a polite little note which the king s secretary had just brought out to the effect that there was nothing to be added to your story of yesterday evening and that he was very busy and must beg to be excused but would be happy to see us at six o clock he was busy all right a blind man could see that scott added impartially busy doing what selden queried busy receiving all the diplomats in nice to say nothing of the shady characters from various down and out circles all the birds of prey along the riviera he was letting them in a good many got past the gates how much farther they got i don t know old buckton the british consul came out while i was there red as a turkey cock and grinning all over and our own ineffable hartley belleville who couldn t have had any possible business there but has to be in on everything well and then what asked selden well some of these fellows represent evening papers and couldn t wait till six o clock and we sent in a round robin pointing this out and what do you think old pietro did he sent out your address and referred us to you fierce wasn t it well we swore awhile and then we tumbled into some cars and rushed over here now stand and deliver what do you want to know everything all right said selden and filled his pipe scott also fished his out of his pocket may i suggest that monsieur speak in french asked one of the french correspondents who had followed this rapid interchange with the utmost difficulty is there anybody here who doesn t understand french selden asked no i guess not said scott fire ahead so selden told the story very much as he had told it in his telegram with perhaps an added detail or two and a little more colour and they all sat and listened and the frenchmen made notes of the unfamiliar american names and asked how they were spelled i always thought you were a democrat said scott when he had finished yet i infer from your tone that you are in favour of letting this old reprobate bribe his way back to power he won t have to do any bribing when his people know he has some real money to spend on the country they ll be only too anxious to have him back that may be true but it is bribery just the same only wholesale instead of retail it is national interest self preservation exactly what every country is governed by i seem to remember some articles of yours in which you were rather dippy about jeneski and his new republic yes but i didn t foresee this alternative you know conditions over there and how much good this money will do besides there is a certain poetic justice in putting it back into the country of the people who earned it scott grunted sceptically just how many millions are there i don t know they ought to be able to find that out in new york how old is the girl about twenty three i should say where does she live in cimiez somewhere i think the family has a villa twenty two avenue victoria piped up one of the frenchmen it is almost impossible to get inside when one does it is always the same thing please go away not at ome at that moment selden s telephone rang excuse me he said and picked up the receiver this is danilo talking said the prince s voice when assured that he had selden on the wire the king has requested me to speak with you all day there have been journalists asking demanding to see him naturally he does not wish to offend them and he has therefore promised to see them at six o clock he very much wishes you also to be present he will send a car for you no i can get over said selden i shall be very glad to come thank you said the prince good bye good bye said selden and glanced at his watch it was a few minutes after four that is all i can tell you fellows now he said it s all i know perhaps we shall learn something more at six o clock the men who served evening papers hurried away to get off their stories hoping to catch the last edition the others departed more leisurely scott remained till the last look here old man he said when the door was shut what do you really think about this affair i m willing to give the king a try said selden perhaps the war has taught him something if he doesn t make good he can always be fired out again it won t be so easy the next time scott pointed out besides it isn t the king it s danilo there is one detail you didn t mention what is it that he has a morganatic wife it s perfectly well known in paris these fellows are all going to play it up are they one of them has even dug up an old picture of her as a ballet dancer was she a ballet dancer yes at the opera but you don t mean to tell me you didn t know about it yes i knew about it but look here scott she may have been a ballet dancer i don t know but i met her to day and i found her an extraordinary woman is she staying here scott inquired yes she and a niece h m said scott and selden knew as well as if he had said it that scott had made up his mind to find her interview her by all means if you can he said you ll see in a minute that it will be an outrage to drag her through the mud i m not going to drag her through the mud scott protested but of course i ve got to mention the marriage and it can t do any harm to see the lady i was wondering though how that angle of the story will strike them over in america i have stopped wondering how anything will strike them over there said selden scott grinned cheerfully yes i know we are not in the league yet but this marriage story may make a difference doesn t it make any difference to you not a particle and it won t make any difference to anybody most americans have been so stuffed with cheap romance and pseudo memoirs and backstairs gossip to say nothing of the movies that they consider a morganatic wife and two or three mistresses as natural to a prince as well as two legs or two arms he is incomplete without them perhaps so scott agreed but i should think it would make some difference to the girl if i were she i d prefer him to have had one wife rather than a dozen mistresses that is one way of looking at it of course said scott slowly but as a matter of fact one woman is far more dangerous than a dozen does she intend to let the prince go yes oh well in that case i suppose it s all right said scott and rose she must be an extraordinary woman see you at six and he put on his hat and walked out for a long time selden sat staring at the door would madame ghita let the prince go after all that was not the bargain she had agreed merely not to make a scene selden took care not to reach the villa gloria in advance of six o clock he wanted to go in as the others did but he had taken the precaution to get the king s secretary on the phone and to give him certain advice to be passed on to his master so they found the prince with his grandfather when they were ushered into the salon both of them were in the national costume it was the first time that selden had seen the prince so attired and he found him much more attractive than in the ordinary garb of western europe the colours suited his dark hair and skin admirably he even had a little of his grandfather s dignity as for the king no one could have looked more regal nothing could have surpassed the urbanity of his greeting as he shook hands with the correspondents one by one there were a lot of them by this time italian french american english among the latter halsey returning the king s smile with an expression which seemed to selden distinctly sardonic but then halsey was always sardonic there was something wrong inside of him perhaps as the french would say he listened to himself too much he caught selden s eye as he turned away from the king but made no sign of recognition evidently he had cut selden from his list of acquaintances i am desolated messieurs said the king that i was not able to receive you earlier but i have been very much engaged it has astonished me the interest awakened by the announcement of my grandson s betrothal and i have been deeply gratified by the felicitations which i have received official felicitations sir asked halsey no said the king those of course must wait upon the formal announcement which will be issued in a few days it is delayed only until the date of the wedding is agreed upon the wedding will be soon no doubt sir inquired one of the italians as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made the baron lappo my minister is already in paris to that end i need not tell you gentlemen how gratified i am to be allied to this powerful american family which will enable us to do so much for our fatherland mlle davis shares this enthusiasm i assure you that you will find her when you meet her to be everything that a queen should be a queen sir asked halsey quickly a restoration is planned then it is at least envisaged said the king i am going to ask my people to choose and i have not the slightest doubt what their choice will be but whether or not we succeed i am still king monsieur and my grandson will be king after me and his son after him we should like very much to meet the lady some one suggested i will see if it can be arranged said the king there is one thing more i wish to say to you it is no secret that some years ago my grandson contracted a morganatic marriage with a young lady in paris a lady for whom i have the very highest respect and esteem this marriage was contracted in the regular way and no attempt was made to conceal it we are in no way ashamed of it and i should much regret to see it made the basis of scandal or innuendo the prince and this lady have been happy together but the hour has come foreseen from the beginning when they must part it is not an easy thing to do but they do it with brave hearts for the sake of my country i find it admirable this sacrifice i hope it will appeal to you messieurs also and that you will treat it tenderly it could not have been better done it was evident that to the latins at least the romantic appeal was irresistible but on halsey s countenance the sardonic expression grew a little deeper and the face of the prince was also a study then somebody said something about photographs and the king summoned his secretary and instructed him to provide them and then he shook each man by the hand again and so did the prince and the interview was over he is a wonder said scott as they went out together and that seemed to sum up pretty well the impression the king had made on all of them to judge by the comments of the crowd most of them were of amused admiration at the way the old king managed to carry things off he was a poseur yes he was a mediaeval old fossil yes but he had always been a friend of the journalist an inexhaustible source of copy so why not be kind to him after all what did it matter who ruled over the few square miles of barren mountains that constituted his kingdom they were all a little weary of reformers and patriots so many of them had proved to be mere wind bags or worse yes they would be kind to the king even scott smiled and said oh well let s give the old boy a chance only selden noticed halsey did not join in this discussion but hurried away as soon as he had passed the gates as though to keep an appointment undoubtedly there would be a slashing article in the journal halsey had unusual powers of invective when he let himself go but perhaps the countess would stop him well selden told himself in either event he did not care he was only an outsider looking on at the comedy and applauding the bits that appealed to him and yet was that all or had he been involved had he a stake in the game but a ballet dancer a woman who was for sale at ciro s it was to ciro s that selden had promised to take the countess that evening and remembering his resolve to give her the best the place had to offer he drove there before going to his room to reserve a corner table and have a word with the head waiter he found that worthy of course most anxious to oblige and fertile in suggestion there had just arrived a shipment of marennes vitesse from la greve they would be delicious yes good monsieur for soup petite marmite perhaps no that would be too heavy croute au pot would be better good for fish a sole perhaps or a trout prepared in a special way no one moment jean bring hither that basket of langouste behold monsieur how fresh how sweet and not too large this one good for garniture trust me monsieur and then partridges perhaps or a wild duck no permit me to suggest pauillac monsieur pauillac veritable very young very tender truly fed with milk delicious with asperges good and for entremet monsieur wishes crepes susettes good for wine martinis first of course then a little sauterne with the oysters and then what would monsieur prefer champagne no bordeaux burgundy permit me monsieur to suggest a chateauneuf du pape of which we are very proud 1915 the great year and from the special vineyard just above avignon good at nine o clock it shall be ready monsieur au revoir monsieur merci bien and selden went on to the hotel feeling as though he had assisted at a sacrament so at nine o clock behold him seated beside the countess remond on the banquette at a corner table the langouste with garniture of pink jelly and ornaments of truffles proudly displayed near by ready to talk to listen to dine and to observe the world at its gambols for ciro s is not only the pleasantest restaurant at monte carlo but the most discreet as well for there sitting in view of all the world one can talk of the most intimate things much more safely than in a private room with the certainty that one s voice will be lost in the lively medley of dancing feet and music and other voices with which the place is always filled and one can dine well also though not quite so well perhaps as in the old days for there is a new proprietor the former one a handsome slim italian who had kept his youth while his wife had lost hers through excessive libations suddenly quarrelled with her sold his business and took train to paris where he now manages a restaurant small and very intime known only to the elect two steps from the avenue de l opera he is a pleasant fellow with a record of many conquests but he goes to see his wife sometimes at the lodging house which she now conducts in the rue st georges and his two daughters who are very fond of him and sends them champagne for their reveillon and their fete days and the chef he took with him now delights his very discriminating parisian patrons the new proprietor is not as handsome as the old and his chef lacks that indefinable something which distinguishes the great artist but he is capable and not without imagination and it is only by comparison that he suffers the sommelier is the same so the cellar is all that could be desired no one can surpass him at a dry martini selden watched him fill the little glasses then leaned back with a sigh of content and looked at his companion she was uncommonly arresting with her air of distinction her eyes a little tilted and fatigued consummate art again she had chosen a black gown of some filmy material which foamed up over her breast accentuating its whiteness and delicate contour and the grace of her arms and shoulders her only ornament was again that strange stone of greenish yellow which matched her eyes she was by all odds the most interesting woman in the room the eyes of the other men were wandering toward her constantly yes and the eyes of the women too but with a different expression for whom had she arrayed herself selden wondered he was sure it was not for him and he looked at the other men but he knew only one of them that was old scott who was dining by himself at a table across the room he looked at selden s companion with marked interest and bowed elaborately when he caught selden s eye but selden answered only with a curt nod which warned scott as clearly as anything could to keep away selden had no objection to his meeting madame ghita but there was no reason why he should know the countess who is your friend she inquired as she drew off her gloves just a newspaper man your bow was not very cordial she commented no i don t want him interfering with this dinner i don t want anybody interfering nobody is going to interfere she assured him and picked up her martini and touched his glass with hers to the fulfilment of all our hopes she said and they drank together what happened to you this afternoon the press has broken loose he answered and told her of his adventures with his fellow correspondents and of the interview with the king it went off better than i expected he added all the boys are inclined to give the old fellow a boost all that is except your friend halsey she turned upon him quickly why do you call him my friend she demanded wasn t it halsey we met on the terrace the other morning yes and he was waiting for you this morning also it is true he is a great nuisance but he can be useful to me in a certain affair and so for the moment i tolerate him that is all selden was certain she was lying but the marennes lying so cool so fresh so green on their little shells demanded his attention the maitre d hotel stood anxiously by until he ate the first one and beamed triumphantly at his approving nod yes they were delicious one reason i like to dine in a french restaurant said selden is because every one is so pleased when one finds the food to one s taste in other countries nobody really cares you can take the food or leave it but here it is a matter of life or death at least they make it appear so and they are wiser than we in another way when a frenchman enters a restaurant he puts his affairs his worries out of his head he thinks only that he is to eat he is smiling and happy he allows nothing to hurry him so he enjoys his food and digests it easily but the american enters in a rush thinking of his business or he brings a paper to read or he gets out his memoranda and makes computations between the courses so he not only does not enjoy his food but he does not digest it and wonders why he has dyspepsia it is very foolish ah here is the croute au pot it also was perfect and then came the serving of the langouste a solemn ceremony performed by the maitre d hotel in person with two of the waiters as acolytes it was at this point that selden tasted the chateauneuf du pape which the sommelier had placed reverently before him and knew definitely that the dinner was a success but you have told me nothing of your adventures he pointed out halsey could rest for a while perhaps later on he might find a way to get back to him you saw the davises yes and she laughed a little the family davis is having for the first time the experience of being internationally important do they enjoy it oh yes at least the mother does enormously about the daughter i am not so sure she has something at the bottom of her heart something i do not understand yes he said as she paused ah well she said with sudden vehemence what woman has not something at the bottom of her heart a little worm which gnaws and gnaws she checked herself and touched her napkin to her lips do not heed me it is nothing at that moment came the pauillac those tender and delicious ribs of milk fed lamb from the country below bordeaux and again the head waiter beamed at selden s approving nod but it was amusing went on the countess those journalists camped about the place as at a siege they have a villa at cimiez the davises a large place which they have taken furnished they have picked up their servants where they could and of course the servants are in no way loyal but are looking only to make all they can out of the rich americans they had orders those servants to admit none of the journalists but first this one and then that one would bribe his way in but it was of no use it seems that baron lappo had impressed upon madame davis that she was not to talk not a word to any one he must have hinted at terrible consequences for she was quite awed and all she would say was please go away over and over again until the butler would come and lead the journalist away indeed she had rather the air of expecting to be blown up but she has set her heart upon being the mother of a queen and nothing will deter her not even assassination she has even the idea that it might be well to cement the union doubly by marrying her son to the princess anna selden laughed i fancy she will have some difficulty there yes but she is counting upon your assistance my assistance she is going to ask you to talk to him since it seems he refuses to listen to her i wonder said selden if all this could be the baron s idea but of course his or the king s they would like to pluck the family clean well young davis will never marry the princess anna do not be too sure the countess warned him the baron is one of the cleverest men in europe a genius at manipulations of this sort it is true that in this case he has for an opponent a very clever woman you know very well that i mean madame ghita she went on in answer to his look and that she destines that young man for this girl she calls her niece i have seen the girl said selden she seems very nice is she not her niece the countess shrugged her shoulders how do i know cicette fayard is the name she goes by and she also will pluck him clean can you doubt it asked the countess a malicious light in her eyes well said selden philosophically since it seems he is certain to be plucked why worry at any rate he will find the process more amusing at the hands of mlle fayard than at those of the baron and the princess anna it will do him good to get some hard knocks but what about his sister are you free to tell me about your interview oh yes it is as i thought she has made up her mind to carry it through she was not astonished or offended that the prince should have had a mistress in fact i think she already knew it you told her straight out but of course why should i use equivoque she is not a child i explained that i was speaking not because i considered the matter of great importance but because i wanted her to be treated fairly and to understand everything what did she say she thanked me entirely without warmth said the countess smiling she does not like me i seem to remind her of some one she dislikes very much nor to be frank do i like her it is instinct i suppose we find ourselves antagonistic selden decided that it was time to gather his forces for the attack did you know her out there in montana he asked i saw her of course but only a few times she was away at school a great deal last night she was looking at you as though wondering where she had seen you before yes i noticed it but i have changed a great deal from the girl she saw occasionally and a little care in make up changes me still more i noted the oriental twist you gave yourself commented selden with a smile i repeated it of course this afternoon so she could not place me and you did not recall yourself to her memory no said the countess and her face darkened i had a special reason for not doing so selden would have liked to know the reason but the countess did not explain it and he could scarcely ask one thing was clear however the person miss davis disliked very much and of whom the countess reminded her was the countess herself his attention was distracted for the moment by the solemn ceremonial attending the preparation of the crepes susettes this too required the finished touch of the head waiter for whom an alcohol lamp surmounted by a silver platter had been prepared he lighted the wicks of the lamp filled the platter with a sauce over which he had been working whose basis was fine champagne and as it began to simmer immersed in it one of the thin pancakes which had been brought from the kitchen he turned the pancake over and over sprinkled it with powdered sugar folded and refolded it gave it a dash of kummel powdered it again and popped it to a plate in the hands of the attendant waiter who hastened to place it piping hot before the countess please eat it at once madame he implored and the countess ate it while selden s was in course of preparation there were three for each of them three indescribably delicious morsels such as only a french chef could conceive there had been a little bustle of new arrivals at the door which selden was too preoccupied to heed and then he looked up to find madame ghita smiling down at him that peculiar little smile which always puzzled him she was perfectly gowned and fully as arresting as the countess more so perhaps though on a different note and with her were two companions miss fayard and young davis selden thought for a moment that she was going to stop but she did not just nodded to them and drifted past in the wake of the obsequious patron with the little fish tail in which her clinging gown terminated sliding noiselessly at her heels and making her look absurdly like a mermaid a siren selden could not help smiling as he looked after her the deep spiritual smile with which one regards a masterpiece yes she is very striking the countess agreed and very intelligent do you not think so and she looked at him curiously of course i think so said selden with a heartiness a shade artificial she is too good for the prince the countess went on she should have for her lover a great artist a poet a dramatist a great journalist like yourself she would arouse him keep him awake furnish him with endless themes and make his future with the prince her talents are wasted perhaps selden suggested with elaborate carelessness after this annuity business is settled and she has further consolidated her position by marrying that girl to davis she will drop the prince and look about her i certainly hope so why asked the countess quickly still looking at him because selden explained the whole point of the situation is not whether the prince has had a mistress but mistress isn t the right word after all he married her with the left hand said the countess there is a difference well the question is not what the prince has done but what he is going to do you will remember she hasn t promised to give him up only not to make a scene involuntarily he looked across at the other table davis and miss fayard had their heads together over the menu madame ghita was sitting with folded hands gazing calmly across at selden and the countess the latter had looked at her too and so she knew of course that they were talking about her selden abruptly changed the subject did you know young davis s father he asked yes he came to see my father quite often they were good friends he was a very genuine human man he and my father and jeneski used to sit for hours talking about all sorts of things jeneski also yes he was a sort of deputy for mr davis in keeping the people in order they were together a great deal the waiter had cleared the table and placed the coffee before them the sommelier at a nod from selden filled two tiny glasses with golden benedictine jeneski is a remarkable man said selden slowly i found him very fascinating i should think he would be especially so to women he is agreed the countess quietly the more so because he finds women less fascinating than politics oh how do you do mr halsey she added in another tone it was indeed halsey who passed on with a curt nod sat down at a table facing them and ordered coffee and liqueur and looking at his sardonic face selden began to glimpse the countess s motive in insisting on this dinner she had need of halsey she herself had said so and she was disciplining him when he proved recalcitrant well one thing was certain he wasn t going to be used as a stalking horse for halsey if he could only fathom the game the countess was playing he doesn t seem very happy he remarked who selden nodded in halsey s direction oh he is never happy said the countess he is one of those unfortunate men who never know what they want or when they do are afraid to pay the price come i will not sit here with him glaring at me besides i have work to do my reports to make to lappo yes she was drawing on her gloves nervously selden asked for the bill and paid it i also have a telegram to send he said as they went out together over his shoulder he saw that halsey was paying his bill he glanced at madame ghita she was looking after them with that little ironical smile which deepened for an instant as she caught his eye m selden said the countess when they were on the esplanade outside i have to thank you for a lovely dinner but more than that for consenting to take me i shall not forget it perhaps i can do something for you some day you can do something for me now said selden what is it persuade halsey to be decent about this affair of the prince but i do not she checked herself very well she said quietly i will see what i can do they were at the hotel entrance thank you selden said he did not look over his shoulder but he was certain that halsey was not far away i am not coming in i ll go over to the postoffice and get my story off good night she held out her hand it is nice of you not to ask any questions and if i do not see you again you are going away i may be called away very suddenly so if i do not see you again remember that i am your friend and wish you good fortune thank you selden answered good night for an instant she permitted him to retain her hand then she drew it away and walked quickly up the steps she waved at him from the top and was gone as he turned the corner he could not resist glancing back a heavy figure was running up the steps to the hotel entrance unmistakably halsey selden turned with a sudden impulse sped back and up the steps into the hotel he must solve this mystery at least he must establish beyond a doubt the connection between halsey and the countess he raced up the stair and reached the upper corridor just as halsey paused before the door of the countess s suite it was evidently ajar for he walked straight in without knocking leaving it open behind him in an instant selden was peering through the crack between door and jamb the countess was taking a telegram from the hand of her maid all right said halsey roughly as he burst in upon her i agree to anything wait said the countess without even glancing at him and ripped open the message with shaking fingers her eyes devoured its contents at a glance then she turned to him with a strange smile so you agree yes you swear it yes it was time she said look at this and she thrust the sheet of paper beneath his eyes halsey stared at it blankly registered parcel wings mailed nice this morning okrim he read what does that mean it is from mirko jeneski s minister she said her whole body quivering and it means that jeneski started for nice this morning by airplane then looking past him she saw the open door you fool she began but selden was safely around the turn in the corridor before the door slammed a promise selden left the hotel and made his way down to the terrace he felt that he had need to collect his thoughts to arrange his ideas he walked up and down for a minute or two until the blood stopped pounding in his temples then sat down on a bench and started to reason it out so the countess was in a plot against jeneski well that was nothing new she had been on lappo s side avowedly from the first and that one of jeneski s ministers should have been corrupted was easy enough to understand but the bearing of the countess as she read that telegram her emotion her fierceness her passion had torn a veil from selden s eyes she was not in this because of friendship for lappo nor because she loved her country she herself had said it for a woman that is not enough but for some personal reason deep compelling malignant she hated jeneski but where did halsey come in what did he mean when he said i agree agree to what something he had held out against something the countess had driven him to perhaps it was only to what selden himself had suggested to forego the chance for a sensation his air had been tragic but that would be a tragedy for halsey like cutting off his right hand and his reward selden shrugged his shoulders it was nothing to him what reward the countess might choose to bestow he cared not at all how many men entered her rooms nor how long they remained poor old halsey he was surely running his head into a noose she was sure of him now she had left her door open knowing that he would follow she had even made him swear heavens what a fool and then a sudden thought stung selden to his feet was halsey the only fool what precipice was it toward which he himself was walking lured by the vision of a face which grew more vivid with every hour more dear a face with calm questioning eyes he would have to have it out with himself the whole question of his relations with this woman this madame ghita this ballet dancer this mistress of a prince what he hoped what he feared have it out without evasion or self deceit and his face was grim for he foresaw that he would not emerge with flying colours hope pah the placid gardien sauntering by was startled to see a man standing by the balustrade suddenly slash viciously at the air with his cane as though laying it savagely across somebody s back and he slackened his pace to observe this madman who had probably lost all his money and to intervene if need be perhaps he designed to cast himself on the railroad tracks below that must be prevented because it would cause a scandal and scandals are frowned upon most heavily at monte carlo but there was no need of intervention for the unknown after a couple of rapid turns up and down the terrace ran up the steps and the gardien following cautiously saw him turn into the postoffice and went back to his beat with a shrug of the shoulders it was not a madman then it was only a fool who instead of killing himself was telegraphing for more money that moment s ebullition had relieved selden besides there was nothing to be gained by beating the air his immediate job was to get off his special to the times and during those quick turns up and down the terrace it had taken shape in his mind first of course a paragraph about the sensation which the exclusive announcement in the times had caused the crowd at the gates of the villa gloria the call made by the hon percy buckton and its apparently satisfactory result mr buckton being the british consul at nice and acting under instructions from lord curzon as to the character of which however he would say nothing the reception of the correspondents picturesque old king and scarcely less picturesque grandson creating most favourable impression baron lappo in paris arranging the marriage settlement wedding to be very soon frantic efforts of the correspondents to see miss davis who had denied herself to everybody except a personal friend or two it had however been the good fortune of the times correspondent to meet her here follow with short and complimentary description and then a discreet paragraph or two about the morganatic marriage quoting the king and treating it as a thing of the past but was it that was the crucial question it was upon that point in seldon s mind at least that the ethics of the whole affair hinged and it was there he felt that he must seek some assurance better than the king s there was only one place to get it there was only one person who really knew for the matter lay wholly in the hands of madame ghita it was she who would decide it was from her that assurance must be sought half an hour later at the booth in the postoffice he had completed his special and was about to sign his name when a sudden thought struck him well why not and he added this final paragraph there is much speculation as to what line jeneski will take with respect to this affair no one who knows him believes for a moment that he will sit quietly by and permit the republic for which he has struggled and which he believes in so thoroughly to be overthrown without a contest he has to face no little opposition at home even among his own ministers but he has shown himself before this to be capable of rapid and decisive actions in a crisis there is a persistent rumour here that he left his capital this morning by airplane for nice there is no confirmation of this rumour and no one can imagine what he hopes to accomplish here if he is really on his way his arrival will give a new twist to a situation already absorbing the attention of many chancelleries he signed his name pushed the sheet through the window waited to be assured that the message had been started and left the building just across the way the great globes at the entrance to the sporting club cast their light along the street and selden without an instant s hesitation turned toward them he was certain that the trio he had seen dining at ciro s would reach there sooner or later and he had made up his mind what to do he was going to demand an answer to the question which was worrying him he was going to find out definitely what madame ghita intended to do it was a little early yet for the club but the rooms were already filled and all the tables were in operation selden strolled from one to another looking for his quarry and he soon discovered davis and miss fayard seated side by side and absorbed in play davis was placing thousand franc notes on adjacent transversales which gave him a chance on nine numbers out of the thirty seven with a double chance on three of them and seemed on the whole to be winning his companion was betting more moderately with plaques or hundred franc chips on the carres four at a time which gave her also a chance on nine numbers but she was less fortunate and her last plaque was finally swept away davis pushed some notes over to her and told her to go on and then he looked up and saw selden watching from across the table hello he said come over here a minute i want to see you before you go he went on when selden had worked his way to his side i ve carried out my part of the bargain have you yes and now i want you to carry out yours we ll talk it over selden agreed where is madame ghita in the buffet i think a newspaper fellow got hold of her a while ago you d better look them up i ll join you as soon as i ve busted the bank i don t think i can wait that long selden protested laughingly returning miss fayard s greeting and turned away to the buffet with considerable misgiving the instant he passed the door he saw madame ghita and seated on the banquette beside her talking away earnestly was paul scott selden was conscious of a decided feeling of relief old scott wouldn t do any harm for some reason he had feared that it was halsey he approached them with a smile scott was too absorbed in his talk to notice him but madame ghita had seen him at once and his heart quickened a little as her smile answered his good evening m selden she said this is very nice you will sit down of course and she made room for him on the banquette you know monsieur monsieur scott is the villain s name said selden as he sat down yes i know him too well indeed scott his discourse brought abruptly to a halt stared at him in indignation see here selden he said don t you know that when a gentleman is talking to a lady third persons aren t wanted it is plain that you are not a man of the world run along now i like it very well here said selden settling back in his seat then my seconds will wait on you in the morning said scott fiercely all right coffee and pistols eh only i ll take my coffee now and he told a waiter to bring him some is it that you are rivals asked madame ghita who had listened to this interchange in evident alarm deadly rivals said selden more than ever at this moment i welcome the prospect of ridding myself of him forever i must say you haven t lost any time he added to scott who introduced you i used your name explained scott with a broad grin it worked like a charm my name it is true said madame ghita her eyes sparkling for she was beginning to understand in the rooms out yonder ten minutes since monsieur introduced himself to me as a friend of yours the infernal impostor but it is his fault scott protested waving his hands figure to yourself madame this afternoon he spoke of you in terms so glowing so complimentary that i would have been less than a man if my interest had remained unawakened i made up my mind to meet you he even approved i consented selden corrected i saw i might as well now that you have met her you d better beat it beat it repeated madame what does that mean i am inviting him to make his adieux selden explained i place myself in the hands of madame said scott with a bow it shall be for her to choose between us ah but that is too difficult she protested yet you must stay a little while if only to tell me what m selden said of me he said you were an extraordinary and fascinating woman madame said scott while selden turned a little crimson an opinion in which i fully concur so when i saw him to night at ciro s with a lady also of unusual charm i could only infer that it was you i did not know that he had turned turk as well as royalist when upon inquiry i found that it was not you i confess that i was shocked yes it is true agreed madame i fear that he is very very inconstant so i warn you against him madame added scott rising be on your guard i even hesitate to leave you alone with him you are going but it is not i who am sending you away no it is duty compelling me i have to get off my story of to day s events good bye then said madame ghita and held out her hand which scott raised to his lips most respectfully then he paused for an instant to look quizzically into selden s eyes you old reprobate he snorted i see through your game but it s all right he added will you have lunch with me to morrow at amiraute s one o clock good till to morrow then the two watched him until he passed from sight then madame ghita turned to selden with a smile a most amusing man she said and a very great friend of yours yes old scott is all right as square as they make them we have been in some close places together what was he talking about he was speaking of you of me of the work you have done and the ideals you have fought for i was very glad to listen and how surprised he was to find you on the king s side now at least not bitterly fighting him willing to give him this opportunity and how he was beginning to understand and to take the same view but that it depended upon me perhaps that you should never regret it and then you came before he had time to explain i will explain madame he said his heart very tender toward old scott who knew him so well then it does depend upon me yes madame absolutely when i came into this club to night he went on it was with the hope of seeing you for i must talk to you quite frankly please do she said her eyes shining i should love to have you speak to me frankly and i i also will be frank i promise it my regret if i ever have any he went on will not be for the king nor for his country the king takes his chance as for the country it will be a great help to have this fortune spent there afterwards the people can choose another ruler if they wish my own thought she nodded my regret will be for the american girl who is involved in all this she is contracting to place her fortune and perhaps her happiness in the hands of prince danilo but he too is contracting something yes a marriage a very serious thing you would say it is serious to an american girl at least madame she knows of course of the prince s alliance with you to that she can have no possible reason to object on the contrary it has been an honourable and recognized arrangement but when she marries him she naturally expects that alliance to cease ah well said madame pensively the prince is casting me off is he not yes but are you casting him off you have already told me that it is in your hands you can keep him if you choose no doubt of that you are the most fascinating woman madame that i have ever known and you are very clever you can do with a man what you will even with you she asked and looked into his eyes ah no do not lie you are an american there is something in you very deep down which holds you back from the supreme follies we latins commit so easily and which even the english sometimes achieve i have seen it how often you think it a merit and because of it at the bottom of your minds you believe yourselves superior to us of europe is it not so perhaps but is it a merit is it not rather a cowardice i do not know madame said selden humbly i suppose we have not the same urge that is it you have not the same urge but is that a thing to be proud of to be more vegetable than we are but if we are happier so happy can one be happy without great moments yes as a cow is happy as a sheep is happy but for me that is not happiness that is ennui i demand more than that for me happiness is to risk everything on one turn of the wheel well you are risking it now selden pointed out oh no i am not she retorted quickly and leaned back a little wearily i am perhaps willing to risk it but the stake is too high the bank refuses to take my bet is it that the bank has other bets and she looked at him sharply i am just an obtuse american madame answered selden steadily though his pulses were pounding madly and not at all good at guessing riddles she looked at him a moment longer then her eyes softened and a little smile played about her lips you are really very clever m selden she said very very clever i knew it the first time i saw you i looked at you well to make sure and i have a great admiration for clever men i have met alas so few but you were speaking of the prince do you wish that i send him away i think it would be best i am not asking what would be best but whether you wish it yes i do said selden brusquely he had had no intention of speaking those words of making that admission of permitting it to become in the slightest degree a personal matter but some force stronger than himself drove them to his lips and he was strangely glad that they were uttered she was looking at him with luminous eyes her parted lips trembling a little very well she said softly i agree and she touched his hand lightly with her fingers that is finished revelations i could be very angry with you if i wished said madame ghita presently at certain things your attitude has seemed to imply it is true that i had never promised to give up the prince but you have appeared to think that i would consent to share him selden was conscious that his cheeks were crimson madame he stammered madame i am not angry she said sadly only i regret that you do not know me better perhaps if you did you would not have thought that of me yes i was a brute agreed selden humbly still hot with shame and contrition can you forgive me ah yes but at least you will prescribe a penance he persisted a severe one shall i she smiled at him very well hereafter you will be my friend yes all my life he promised but that is not a penance that is a reward ah my friend she said laughing do not be too sure i can be very exacting sometimes so you may find it a penance a very heavy one before you have finished i am proud to take the risk he said covering her hand for a moment with his own we must pledge this friendship she nodded assent and a waiter took the order and hurried away what is it you propose to do with young davis asked selden after a moment are you concerned for him also inquired madame ghita drily not in the least only curious i suppose you know that they are planning to marry him to the princess anna a flame of anger sprang into madame s eyes but he wants too much that old king she cried he forgets that there are other people in the world well in this he shall be disappointed you will marry davis to mlle fayard i suppose it will not be my doing he loves her yes i think he does selden agreed and she is a good girl cicette not very clever perhaps but more clever than is he she will make him a good wife between us we will educate him he is not bad at bottom but he is very ignorant it seems impossible that any man should be so ignorant it is impossible except in america he has never had to learn anything he has grown up with his eyes shut he has been spoiled by a mother who is too fond of him cicette is fond of him but she will not spoil him not in that way he has one great virtue he is kind hearted and generous yes remarked selden too much so perhaps i noticed that he was staking mlle fayard at the table out yonder that was not wise no it was not agreed madame quickly i did not know it i will see that it does not occur again every one seeing it would believe that they are lovers but it is not true i have taken care of that and indeed he has never suggested such a thing there is one point in the character of american men which i find truly admirable which even gives me to marvel she added they are nice to women without demanding anything in return they will help a girl just for the pleasure of it without expecting to be paid in any other way no other men are like that and cicette she is not silly do you know what is her dream to marry a good man to settle down to have many children and to be faithful to her husband that is the dream perhaps of every woman she went on musingly but many of us cannot bring ourselves to make the necessary sacrifices we lack strength of character cicette is different she understands things she will be very good to him and she will not expect too much he will be very happy with her she will not be exacting she will guide him without annoying him heaven knows he needs guidance selden agreed you will not oppose it then she asked looking at him anxiously oppose it what right have i to oppose it but i don t even wish to on the contrary i have half promised to intercede for him with his mother that is good of you she said and her eyes were shining again oh come he protested i want to do it you are absurdly grateful for little things they have always meant so much to me the little things she said of course if i had any sense he went on roughly to hide his emotion i d keep out of it since it is no affair of mine ah well she began and stopped you were going to say that neither is his sister s future any affair of mine but it is in a way since without knowing it i helped her to make up her mind so i want the prince to treat her fairly where is the prince to night he telephoned that his father is ill very ill i do not think so he has been exerting himself too much he forgets that he has eighty years he is a wonderful old man said selden it is a pity he did not pass on his qualities to his grandson perhaps his great grandson will inherit them suggested madame and some american ones as well i confess said selden smiling that absurd as it may sound something like that has been in my mind how serious you are she commented do you plan that far ahead for yourself also to my great grandson oh no i haven t even got to the children yet but you expect to marry some day perhaps but not while i am merely a wandering newspaper man it wouldn t be fair to the woman some day i suppose i shall settle down the trouble is i don t want to settle down not for a long time you see i m like those women you spoke of not willing to make the necessary sacrifices without strength of character you have not even a little friend she asked quite simply no oh i don t pose as a saint he added hastily but i have been tremendously busy and tremendously interested in other things which have kept my mind occupied besides i am a coward i m afraid i d marry her if she was very nice to me there are women who like to wander too who make good companions on the road i know it but confess she broke in the real reason is that you have never been in love yes he said soberly watching the waiter as he filled their glasses i am ashamed to confess it because it proves that i am lacking somewhere but i suppose that is the real reason he picked up his glass and touched it to hers to our new friendship which will never grow old that is the nicest toast i ever drank she said and raised her glass to her lips tell me he went on after a moment you said something at lunch to day which puzzled me what was it you said to the countess that you had always understood she was jeneski s friend what did you mean by that she hesitated are you very fond of her i am not fond of her at all is it true quite true she repels me she took a quick little breath all i know is what the prince has told me she said that jeneski was living with a woman known as the countess remond whom he had met in america and who had been married to lappo s illegitimate son and that he had had a small estate restored to her she hates jeneski now said selden they quarrelled i suppose or perhaps he never was her lover gossip like that starts easily yes she said something to me just to night what was it oh yes that he found women less fascinating than politics well so do you so do most men if not politics then something else we are always second to something but that is as it should be it is a sign of strength life has taught me that i wish you would tell me something about your life said selden you really wish it i have heard so many things ah well you shall know the truth i should like you to know though there is really not much to tell my father was a merchant of lace a traveller you understand selling it to the shops in various towns one of these shops was at perigueux and was managed by a young woman with whom my father fell in love they married and moved to paris where they opened a magasin not to sell to persons but to other shops you understand what we call a wholesaler yes they did very well and the business grew until it occupied the whole first floor of a building on the rue de rivoli near the chatelet my mother really managed it but she found time nevertheless to have two children two girls my sister resembled her but i resembled my father and he was very fond of me he still travelled from town to town taking orders for the business sometimes he would take me with him he would wash and dress me in the morning and comb my hair and in the evening i would sit at the table with all the men listening to their talk and understanding more than they imagined we were very happy together but he was a strange man and once he got an idea into his head it never left him for example he had once lost a parcel through the carelessness of a porter at a railway station and had made a vow that no porter should touch his baggage in future so at every stop he would send the porters away with dreadful insults and stagger along the platform with his great cases of lace on his back and i would follow very much ashamed for i could see that people were laughing at him however it made no difference but those good times did not last my father began to gamble and the habit grew so strong that in the end my mother could scarcely find the money to meet the bills each month when he came home there were scenes terrible scenes during which he sometimes threw all the dishes into the street then he would promise to reform but always the habit was too much for him it was like a disease getting worse and worse i do not know what happened at the end i was only fourteen years old but one evening i went to his room to call him to dinner i knocked but he did not answer i opened the door and saw him sitting in his chair before his desk i ran to him and threw my arms around him and he fell over against me he was dead he had shot himself she stopped for a moment and passed her hand before her eyes that was the end of the business she went on it was taken away from us to pay the debts everything was sold my sister and i were sent to england to a convent school it was there i got such english as i have and mother went to work again in a shop it was very hard for her but there was nothing else to be done we were gone three years when we came back she had married again a maitre de danse at the opera he was old and very eccentric and all that he wanted of my mother was that she should make a home for him and she did a very good one it was not amusing but it was better than working in a shop then came the war and for a time there was no more dancing so to amuse himself and keep himself occupied he gave lessons to me and to my sister with my sister he soon stopped and sent her to learn to be a typist but with me he kept on all day every day until i dropped with fatigue not dancing only but many other things how to walk how to talk how to acknowledge an introduction how to hold my fork how to eat from my spoon he said the french are pigs because they take their soup from the end of the spoon instead of from the side he was very clever a little mad perhaps but to him i owe everything he was mad about the drama but the classics only whenever there was a great play at the comedie or the odeon he took me to see it fortunately he could get tickets or we should have been ruined when there was no performance we spent the evening reading racine moliere hugo i know them all by heart and then when at last the opera opened again every day he took me with him to rehearsal and before long i was in the ballet a year later the premiere danseuse fell ill one night and i took her place and did so well that i was given an engagement you know perhaps what the life of the stage is there are no reticences no privacies if you have ever been to the opera on the night of a ballet you have noticed that the front row of seats is empty until the ballet is about to begin then a number of old men come in and take the seats most of them have decorations many of them are famous in art or literature or diplomacy and each carries an opera glass they have come to see the girls especially the particular girl each of them is protecting and when the ballet is over they come back and watch the girls dress and carry them off to supper somewhere well it was from that my step father protected me he could not protect me from the knowledge of what was going on from the loose talk and coarse jests but at least i remained vierge it was a greater merit on his part than on mine for those old men disgusted me but he could have made a little fortune perhaps he had something else in his mind for me something greater at any rate in the end he made my mother come with me to watch over me better than he could and every night i went home between them everybody called them the dragons and then one night after i had danced very well the director brought danilo back and introduced him to my mother and to me i thought him very handsome and distinguished then my step father came and they talked together for many minutes my step father shaking his head all the time finally we went home and my step father was very silent all the way after that the prince came back almost every evening and talked to us and brought me little gifts of flowers and bon bons once he gave me a ring but my mother made me return it he scarcely glanced at the other girls though they did all they could to attract him and he had other talks with my step father at last one day my step father took me to his study and bade me sit down my child he said you are twenty two years old and it is time you thought of your future i shall not be able to watch over you much longer for some day my weak heart will stop beating and before that i should like to see you range yourself this prince now what do you think of him he is not bad i said but he is too young you are right and if it was merely the question of a protector i would prefer an older man he would know better how to value you and you would have the benefit of his experience but none of those old fellows would marry you do you mean that the prince will marry me i asked astonished you will not be his wife exactly said my step father and yet you will be more than his mistress and he explained to me as well as he could what a morganatic marriage is some day he will have to marry again for reasons of state but by that time you will have acquired a knowledge of the world a certain position and should be able to look out for yourself he has not much money but a prince does not lack money like an ordinary man for there are always people willing to provide it just for the privilege of being seen with him it will be a great education for you and i advise you to accept but my dancing i objected my child he said i will speak to you frankly you are a good dancer but you will never be a great artist no your place is in the world but will his family consent i asked yes he has caused them many anxieties and they wish him to settle down with some nice girl until they can find a very wealthy wife for him that is not possible at present of course they will wish to see you what do you say what could i say except yes it was as my step father said a great opportunity much better than i could have hoped for a few days later baron lappo came to see me he approved of me and so the marriage was arranged behold the result and she offered herself with a little gesture as a showman might offer his wares the result is wholly admirable said selden yes you were right to accept and your step father his heart stopped beating one day as he had foretold she answered her lips trembling he was the best man i ever knew but your mother is living oh yes she lives with my sister my sister married a little bourgeois shopkeeper they manage the business much better than he could and mlle fayard she is the daughter of my step father s younger sister i promised him to look after her selden looked at her musingly how far she had already travelled from her humble beginning how interesting it would be to watch her future to see what she made of herself to what heights she rose what are you thinking she asked i am thinking you will go far he said some day a man will be prime minister because of you or there will be a great poem a great play a great picture of which you were the inspiration and i shall go to the minister or to the artist and congratulate him and say monsieur i foretold this long ago one evening at monte carlo her eyes were shining again and she laid her hand lightly upon his perhaps you are right my friend she said but it is not of that i am thinking what are you thinking that i hope to find love some day she said and raised her hand for an instant to her eyes selden takes an inventory i hope to find love some day those words were in selden s mind when he went to sleep that night and when he awoke next morning and he lay for a long time thinking of the woman who had uttered them and of the story she had told him to find love some day there was a fit ambition for every human heart but how often it was pushed aside by greed by cynicism by selfishness by fear by any number of cold and worldly things as it had been with himself he could not but admit it perhaps in some thin and far off fashion he still hoped to find love some day there had been moments haunted by a vision of himself seated cosily before a glowing hearth and not alone but somehow as the years passed that figure sitting there in slippered ease had grown older and older grey haired even a little stiff in the joints from long campaigning it had remained himself indeed but always himself thirty years hence for it is not only true that a rolling stone gathers no moss but wishes to gather none as time goes on even grows to fear moss or anything else that mars the hard smoothness which enables it to keep on rolling selden had been rolling now for many years it was his first assignment to foreign work to cover one of the balkan wars which had enabled him to cast loose his anchors and he had never been seriously tempted to pick them up again he had come to love rolling for its own sake the wandering life of the special writer was congenial to his blood it was of intense interest for it enabled him to get past the fire lines at every holocaust and it gave him a prestige a sense of power impossible to any sedentary job the thought of being chained to a desk of being chained even to a house revolted him he wanted always to be able to throw his things into a bag and take the road at a moment s notice without the necessity of explanations to any one or anything to hold him back for a long time he had told himself that it was his career he was jealous of that nothing should touch that it should be his task to interpret europe to america and america to europe to labour night and day to bring the peoples of the old and the new worlds to a mutual comprehension and a common interest but of late questionings had crept in whispered doubts was he really accomplishing anything was he really going ahead as he lay there that morning thinking it over taking such inventory of himself as he could he realized that it was no longer any thought for his career which drove him on but merely the force of habit he had reverted to type the stone had been rolling so long that rolling had become a second nature for in spite of the convention which women sedulously foster and even sometimes believe man is not by nature a domestic animal he has been partially tamed by centuries of restraint his spirit has been broken by the manifold burdens laid upon him for generation after generation all the pillars of society have struggled to convince him that the greatest blessings he can hope to win in this world are a wife and children and that his highest privilege is to labour to support them all the forces of law of civilization of public opinion have conspired to hobble shackle and coerce him and yet in spite of everything he sometimes manages to break loose while few women suspect what moments of desperation often overwhelm even the meekest father of a family selden had broken loose now at last he was beginning to wonder whether freedom was worth the price as for his career he had reached its apex he could go on writing specials yes he could go on casting a feeble light into the dark corners of the earth dissecting the motives of public men perhaps influencing public opinion a little a very little but he would never be any more powerful any better known than he was at that moment indeed his influence and his fame must both diminish imperceptibly for a while perhaps but none the less surely for he could not hope that the future would by any possibility bring such opportunities as the past six years had brought from this point onward his career could be only a descent besides he was himself growing weary of the game the world had gone stale had gone cold and sceptical the fine enthusiasms the wide sympathies the common brotherhood of war days had waned and vanished and his own enthusiasms had vanished too he remembered bitterly the ardour with which he had gone to work to combat the traducers of the league of nations and with what certainty of success he had felt sure of his country of her generous soul her instinct for right her jealousy of her honour and he had never recovered from the shock when she denied the league it had left him stunned and incredulous he had buckled on his armour again and laboured to set her right but so far as he could see with absolutely no result he had simply wasted his time the doctrine of world effort of world helpfulness of world responsibility which he had preached with such conviction had fallen upon deaf or hostile ears so he preached it no longer he was worn out but what remained nothing that seemed to him worth while oh he could still bring some food to austria s starving children he could still help or hinder the plans of a petty king he could still take france s part in her struggle against isolation but other men could do that just as well as he perhaps it would be better worth while if he could make a woman happy a woman whom no other man could make happy but how imbecile to suppose there was such a woman and if there were what had he to offer her to drag her down with him on his long descent no that was a journey which he would make alone and at this point he threw off the covers bounded out of bed rang for breakfast and plunged into his bath which he made much colder than usual he needed bracing he was getting soft after breakfast he settled resolutely to work on the last of his austrian articles a summary of the situation not half so desperate as certain financiers had pictured it for nothing could deprive vienna of her position at the very centre of the system along which flowed the trade of central europe he kept doggedly at work until it was finished and as he read it over he decided that it was the best of the lot at least he told himself he had not forgotten how to write so it was to a composed and apparently normal selden that the card of mr charles wharton davis was presently handed in with that young gentleman close behind it it seemed to selden as he greeted him that his air was unusually subdued you didn t wait for me last night davis began accusingly no did you finally break the bank damn the bank i want to talk to you seriously all right fire ahead but sit down won t you davis sat down and looked about the room for a moment as though trying to find a place to begin i had another talk with mother this morning he said finally about miss fayard yes she got quite violent says she has other plans for me that she ll tie up all my money i know said selden smiling she wants you to marry the princess anna my god groaned davis his face turning pale with horror that that why she s got a moustache selden no i won t do it look here you ve got to help me i ve done my part suppose you tell me about that first selden suggested oh it was just as i thought said davis disgustedly sis knew all about it she fired up and told me to mind my own business none of my family takes me seriously mother thinks this is just a boy and girl affair it s not i m a man and i m going to be treated as a man wait a minute said selden you re getting ahead of your story tell me exactly what you said to your sister i asked her if she knew that danilo had a morganatic wife because if she didn t know it i thought it was my duty to tell her so yes and what did she say she said of course she knew it that that was all arranged and that she wished i would attend to my own affairs which certainly required my attention i said yes i knew they did and that if she wanted to be a real sister to me she d help me out that i d fallen in love with the sweetest girl on earth go ahead selden encouraged as davis paused what did she say to that she said piffle or something like that and then i got mad and told her that she couldn t fool me that i had seen through her from the start all that fol de rol about helping that little stinking country out there when her whole object was just to get even with jeneski because he had thrown her over wait a minute selden interrupted sitting bolt upright what do you mean by that do you mean that jeneski and your sister were engaged to be married oh no i was just laying it on a little heavy but jeneski and father were always chewing the rag in the library of evenings and sis used to hang around and pretend she understood and all she could talk about was jeneski and the wonderful things he was going to do she was certainly crazy about him and then all at once she shut up and after a while i learned that jeneski had pulled out for europe so i just put two and two together but i may be all wrong what did your sister say when you made this er accusation oh said davis with a grin the door slammed about then selden sat for a moment looking at him could this be the key to myra davis s conduct it fitted certainly or seemed to and yet so since i couldn t get any sympathy at home i came over here davis concluded well you are not going to get much here said selden if you want to be treated like a man you ve got to act like one and a man doesn t drink too much champagne whenever he gets the chance nor fool away his time at a roulette table nor live off of money somebody else has earned i think it is a good thing your money is tied up maybe you will have to go to work and i ll never ask your mother to turn it over to you not till you have proved there is something in you i might ask her to allow you something to live on till you can find a job and i might point out to her that miss fayard is a darn sight too good for you but not till you promise to brace up davis s face had darkened a little at the beginning of this tirade but it was radiant before selden finished i ll do anything you say he protested i know i ve been a good deal of a rotter just give me a chance all right said selden that s exactly what i m proposing to do then i ll go tell cicette it s all settled and davis jumped to his feet how do you mean settled selden demanded i m going to reform and you re going to see mother that s the bargain isn t it i m going to see your mother after you have reformed well this is after davis pointed out with a grin i reformed fully five minutes ago look here old man he went on more seriously don t think i m not eternally grateful i am shut up and get out selden ordered he was beginning really to like the boy come and have lunch with me davis suggested maybe madame ghita will let me take cicette if you re along good lord i ve an engagement for lunch and selden jerked out his watch i can just make it get out of here all right said davis but remember my fate is in your hands half an hour later selden and scott sat down together at a little table on the terrace of amiraute s among the olive trees high above the sea and attacked a great dish of tiny sole browned to a crisp and unbelievably sweet and delicate which scott had ordered and after that there were tournados garnished with slices of foie gras and finally there was a basket of fruit and nuts figs from the oases of the sahara grapes from malaga oranges from morocco paper shelled almonds and walnuts from the aures they had talked of desultory things of old experiences during the meal but with the coffee and cigars scott brought the talk abruptly back to the present anything new about the restoration he asked no except that i heard last night jeneski is on his way here scott whistled softly what do you suppose he expects to do heaven knows he will stir up some excitement anyway said scott i met him once he s an electric sort of fellow you can almost see the sparks flying when he gets excited and he will be excited all right but it seems to me the person to be pitied most in this affair isn t jeneski or miss davis but danilo why do you pity him well if it was me said scott slowly i wouldn t give up a woman like madame ghita not for any throne on earth and neither would you scott added looking at him no i wouldn t selden agreed gazing out across the water not if she loved me you mean she doesn t love the prince well i suppose not she is a very extraordinary woman she got me to talking about you last night he added in another tone she wanted to know all about you yes said selden she told me you had been blowing off i could see what you were trying to do i appreciate it old man scott nodded curtly it is finished then her affair with the prince yes that s fine said scott and nodded again what are you going to do now you have finished your balkan stuff he asked after a moment i don t know i was thinking about it this morning the fact is scott i have lost my edge i m beginning to go downhill nonsense scott protested downhill you make me tired but there was a certain anxiety in his eyes as he looked at selden it is true though you know what i have been working for and how i have failed the league is dead so far as america is concerned i don t believe it anyway my people have intimated that i might as well quit writing about it nobody wants to read that sort of stuff any more it seems scott puffed his cigar reflectively for a moment i m inclined to think you are right old man in a certain sense he said at last as a special correspondent you have reached the summit you can t go any higher because there is no higher place to go to but that doesn t mean you are going to give up fighting for the things you believe in you have a following i don t think you realize how large it is and right now is the time for you to strike out for something bigger such as what asked selden sceptically i haven t thought it out but what i see at this moment is a great liberal weekly with you as editor in chief and the strongest kind of a staff the kind you could get together better than any other man i know i have thought for a long time that the day of the literary monthly the scribner harper century type is about over and that the time is ripe for the liberal weekly dealing in a large way with world affairs and social progress and politics and art and literature too of course i know there are already three or four but they are all handicapped by some sort of mental bias or astigmatism or spiritual dyspepsia now is the time for the real thing and you are the man to start it selden laughed a little bitterly i didn t know you were such a dreamer scott it isn t a dream yes it is apart from all question of myself where is the money to come from you don t imagine it would be self supporting of course not not for a long time it must have financial backing the right sort strong enough to make it independent in every way but how can a liberal paper hope to get financial backing how can any paper get financial backing without mortgaging its opinions it can t be done yes it can said scott at least i believe it can there must be one disinterested millionaire somewhere in the world i ll take a look for him meanwhile there is another thing you want to do get married to the right woman i suppose you ve already got her picked out for me remarked selden with irony as it happens i have said scott coolly i was talking to her last night selden stared at him all his blood in his face do you mean madame ghita he asked of course i do scott answered curtly but look here selden stammered you re joking of course do you suppose i d have the nerve i m not good enough for her i m not big enough of course you re not broke in scott impatiently but that doesn t matter if you can make her happy think what it would mean to live with a woman like that yes said selden between set teeth i have thought and she could make any man big if she loved him ah yes agreed selden hoarsely if she loved him she couldn t love me i don t know retorted scott women do strange things sometimes why not ask her and he threw away his cigar and called for the bill a philosopher discourses it was not merely or even principally to arrange the articles of settlement that the baron lappo had gone so hastily to paris the terms of the articles had already been agreed upon after exhaustive debates with mrs davis s solicitor tentative drafts had been exchanged and the final one was even then in the baron s hands with but a minor detail or two needing correction trivial matters easily arranged by post but the royal exchequer was low empty as a matter of fact and the need of replenishment was so urgent that the baron had excused himself a few minutes after selden s departure from the betrothal dinner changed hurriedly into travelling clothes while his valet packed his bag and had managed to catch the paris express he had reached paris early the following afternoon had driven straight to the rooms of a private banker in rue lafitte who forewarned by wire was awaiting him and had at once as was his habit placed all his cards on the table these cards had been examined carefully by a fat gentleman with a black curly beard and a type of countenance unmistakably hebraic and had proved so satisfactory that the baron was able to get away at the end of an hour and to catch mrs davis s solicitor upon his return from a leisurely lunch the final details of the settlement were soon agreed upon and arrangements made to have the official copies prepared at once he had then spent an hour at the quai d orsay and another half hour at the british embassy in rue du faubourg st honore had gone back to rue lafitte for a final talk with his banker and then to the offices of the solicitor in the avenue de l opera where the official copies of the agreement were awaiting him and had arrived at the gare de lyon in time to catch the train for marseilles leaving at 8 50 very tired but triumphant it was about the middle of the next afternoon that he stepped out again upon the platform at nice entered the car which was awaiting him and was whirled away to the villa gloria where he found the king recovering from the heart attack of the previous day it had been a severe one brought on as always by over eating the king was a gourmet not to say a glutton with not always the strength to resist temptation it was one of baron lappo s duties to supply this strength in his absence the task usually devolved upon the princess anna but she had been ill the day before and the chef had been so ill advised as to prepare a rich pillaff of which the king was very fond with the consequence that for a time he had been very ill indeed the baron uttered no reproaches but there was that in his look which would have made the king blush if he had not already been so rubicund do not be cross with me my old friend he said it is the only pleasure i have left but at this moment the baron pointed out your majesty should be very careful it would be most unfortunate if the impression got about that you are subject to such attacks i am not dead yet said the king though i confess that for a time i was uncertain about it you have the papers they are here and the baron spread them out everything is as we wished what are the exact figures asked the king the estate when all the debts had been settled and the taxes paid amounted to seventy five millions of this a third was left to the daughter a third to the son and a third to the wife the wife s share to be held in trust after her death for any grandchildren the son s share is also in trust the daughter s is to be paid over to her upon her marriage but must remain her property not her husband s we cannot object to that said the king she will have then how much about twenty five million dollars sire that is how much in the currency of our country at present rates nearly three billions ah said the king thoughtfully what cannot be done with such a sum half of it will suffice that is also my opinion said the baron and the remainder can be put aside as a foundation for our house if we could get the boy also his money will never be really his it is held in trust for his children magnificent said the king it would make our house the richest in europe yes we must arrange it but meanwhile my good lappo as you know we have nothing did you see hirsch yes sire and he is willing to make a loan three hundred thousand francs to be repaid one month after the marriage the terms added the baron are rather stiff no matter said the king who was used to stiff terms when can we get the money i have arranged for the notary and an official of hirsch s bank to come this evening prepared to pay it over after your majesty and danilo have signed the necessary papers danilo must not fail to be present good said the king i will attend to that this does more to cure me than all the doctors he added there is no illness so annoying as lack of money and the settlement that also must be signed without delay i had thought of to morrow morning said the baron very well agreed the king you will make the arrangements i have also to report said the baron an attitude of benevolent neutrality on the part of the french and british governments they have no disposition to interfere so long as there is no bloodshed italy of course we can count on our success therefore seems assured unless the prince do not worry about danilo said the king he will do as i tell him he knows his duty you have provided for his wife i have caused an offer to be made her by whom by the countess remond ah yes said the king reflectively you think you can trust her absolutely sire she has reasons to be grateful to me and to hate jeneski you are right not to count too much upon gratitude said the king but hate yes that is better she is a clever woman we must not forget her and he turned to the papers on his desk the baron retired to his cabinet to look through his mail and there he found the report from the countess of her interview with madame ghita and of her acceptance but it contained no reference to the receipt of the telegram from goritza heralding jeneski s arrival the baron read the report attentively especially a long postscript in which selden s name occurred and nodded approval once or twice then he ordered his car made a careful toilet and presently sallied forth to call upon mrs davis in her villa at cimiez and after a most satisfactory conversation with her directed his chauffeur to proceed by the coast road to monte carlo selden had declined scott s proffer of a lift back to his hotel no i ll walk he said it will do me good the moment had come when he must arrange his future when he must decide what he was going to do he felt that he must be alone that he could not meet any of the actors in the drama certainly not madame ghita until that decision had been reached and he was the prey of many and violent emotions for he began to perceive that the decision might not rest wholly in his hands scott was a fool of course in thinking there was any chance for him but at least he must make up his mind whether he should try to win her or whether he should flee it was evident that his only sure safety lay in flight he could no longer trust himself and he told himself again and again that he was a fool to hesitate yet to flee from such a woman wasn t that more foolish still the thought of life with her turned him giddy set his blood on fire but how could he support her there was no admiring public ready to pay for the privilege of dining with a newspaper man even if he had been willing to accept life on such terms and she would have to renounce the king s bounty for it was equally impossible for him to live on money acquired as that would be but what right had he to ask her to do that what had he to offer in return no he couldn t do it he must go away and then the memory of her eyes of her voice rent him anew he was in love he in love he stood away and looked at himself with a sneer what a pitiable object he had become yes he must go away at once when he finally got back to his room he hauled out his bag and began to pack slowly with long periods of abstraction it was thus the baron found him it needed but a glance at selden s tortured face to tell that astute old student of human nature what was amiss yes i am back you see he said as he took the proffered chair everything is arranged and i have come to ask you to do madame davis and myself one more favour i have no shame i am always asking what is the favour the articles of settlement are to be signed to morrow morning mrs davis would consider it a very great favour and so should i if you would sign as a witness in her behalf selden hesitated there is nothing in the terms of the settlement to which you could object went on the baron the entire fortune of miss davis remains absolutely in her hands the prince gets nothing except a small annuity we preferred it so we hope of course that she will choose to use a portion of her fortune to rehabilitate our country which will be her country also but the bulk of it will be conserved for the benefit of her children still selden hesitated come said the baron tell me frankly what is in your thought i am wondering said selden whether miss davis will be happy it is evident that she is not in love not at least with the prince supplemented the baron what do you mean i may be wrong said the baron because i do not understand your women but i have observed miss davis as carefully as i could naturally since i had need to do so and i have become more and more convinced that somewhere in her life there has been an unhappy love affair from which she has never quite recovered that happens does it not even to american girls yes of course said selden i admit it does not seem probable but it is the only explanation i can find of a thing which has appeared to me very strange for the only question she has asked herself apparently about this marriage is not whether she would be happy but whether she would be useful yes said selden again she asked me just that not for a moment so far as i could see has she thought of love that i confess seemed to me unnatural though perhaps american girls do not think of love and the baron shrugged his shoulders helplessly or perhaps they are ashamed of it i do not know as for happiness are your american marriages always happy no not always selden admitted with a smile i have never seen one that appeared so said the baron not as a french marriage is very often happy to me american husbands and wives seem merely bored with each other why should two people stay together when they would be happier apart you see only the worst ones over here and a lot of people are held together by habit by fear of ridicule or loss of position we are cowards in that respect yes we are not like that for one thing our women try to keep themselves interesting to their men and they are not ashamed of love they do not consider a husband merely a source of funds a bank very often they manage his affairs for him and better than he could the attitude of the husband too is different with you women are an ornament with us they are a passion too much so perhaps commented selden it may be yes no doubt our men are less faithful than yours but they are also less cruel they do not outlaw a woman because she has had a lover they do not regard her as therefore ruined it was dumas was it not who pointed out that a woman s virginity belongs not to the first man who possesses her but to the first man she truly loves to whom for the first time she really surrenders for it is to him only she gives everything well our men believe that yes said selden in a low voice yes and after all went on the baron lighting a cigarette it is a much greater compliment to a man a much more difficult thing to achieve to be a woman s last lover than it is to be her first one to be a woman s first lover that is nothing she is curious she wishes to know what love is she has not perfected her defence a man needs only to be a little good looking and not too stupid but to be her last one that is different to emerge victorious from the comparisons that she makes to impress her as no one else has done to awaken something in her that no one else has been able to awaken to cause her to say to herself i will seek no further i am content i love him to accomplish that a man must be very clever very intelligent it is a triumph there is no higher tribute perhaps it is a tribute miss davis will pay the prince suggested selden with a smile i was not thinking of miss davis said the baron but it is possible the prince is not without brains at least i trust she will be happy as well as useful i give you my word as a man of honour that i shall do everything in my power to make her so i am sure of it said selden and i shall be glad to be present to morrow morning as mrs davis s witness thank you said the baron at eleven he made a little motion as if to rise then glancing again at selden s face lighted another cigarette and settled back in his chair tell me about yourself he said what has been going on here nothing has been going on i have been doing a little work and annoying myself a great deal annoying yourself about what if i may ask about my future ah said the baron does it not please you your future as a matter of fact answered selden with a crooked grin i have suddenly discovered that my future is behind me the baron took a long puff of his cigarette and exhaled the smoke slowly your americanisms sometimes puzzle me he said what you mean i suppose is that you do not at this moment see ahead of you any work which seems as important as that which you have already done not at this moment or any moment worse still i am beginning to despair of human nature i but you are wrong very wrong broke in the baron here am i with at least twice your age my whole life spent in the most cynical of all professions and my admiration for human nature grows stronger and stronger day by day i listen to the pessimists with a smile the prophets of evil do not frighten me i grant all their contentions that man is naturally evil that he has used such glimmering light of reason as he may possess only to become more bestial than the beasts that five thousand years of civilization have culminated in five years of atrocity fiendishness and insanity yes but in the midst of it all in the very worst of it there were flashes of splendour flashes of kindliness and courage and self sacrifice there is something of that in all of us and that is the miracle it should not astonish us that men are full of ignorance and vice but that they are capable of the heroisms they sometimes attain you have been looking at the wrong side of the shield my friend perhaps i have agreed selden in a low voice well turn it over said the baron he paused a moment evidently in doubt whether to go on i am an old man he continued at last and i have seen a great deal of life also i esteem you very highly so you will permit me to say something which in another might seem an impertinence it is this do not fear to seize happiness when it comes your way do not hesitate or draw back or run away it is a rare thing happiness a very rare and fleeting thing even at best we can only hope to taste it briefly now and then how silly how cowardly to permit a single moment of it to escape that he added is all i have learned in the sixty years that i have been on earth but many men do not learn even that not until it is too late he sat for a moment longer looking at selden with his wise old eyes then he rose abruptly good bye my friend he said till to morrow at eleven the unlit lamp it was a decidedly nervous and shaken selden who dressed for dinner that evening for the first time in his life he had committed what is for a journalist the unpardonable sin he had permitted his feelings to become involved in an affair which he had set himself to watch from the outside he had ceased to be an observer and had become a participant yet permitted was scarcely the word for he seemed to have had no volition in the matter he had been drawn in against his will but he told himself grimly it was because his struggles to escape had been half hearted he might have saved himself had he heeded the first signals of danger it was his cursed inability to make up his mind that had brought him to his present pass he had dabbled with temptation and now it was too late the whirlpool had him no that was not true either let him at least be man enough to be candid with himself he could escape even now if he really wanted to he had only to finish packing his bag go to the station get aboard the first train and permit it to carry him away but that was such a cowardly thing to do oh own up you idiot he groaned between his teeth it s not because it is cowardly you don t do it own up it s because you don t want to escape and staring at himself in the glass he realized that this was the truth he had got down to it at last he didn t want to escape it was finished he might still struggle a little in an instinctive sort of way but unless some power outside himself seized him and threw him clear yes and in that event he had the horrid consciousness that he would fight with all his strength against that power what is it i am afraid of he asked himself the baron is right a man is a fool not to seize happiness when it comes his way if he could only have happiness without capitulation if he could have love fighting at his side for some great ideal that were to be blessed indeed but if love should drag him down well even then he would have love why had the baron talked to him like that was it perhaps that he had some inkling and old scott too the sharp ringing of his telephone bell startled him out of his thoughts this is davis said the voice at the other end what are you doing to night nothing in particular selden answered the only thing he had definitely planned was to go to the club in the hope of finding madame ghita there then come up and have dinner with us who is us madame ghita miss fayard and myself we are having a dinner to celebrate a very special event one in which you are particularly interested where is the prince asked selden he can t come until later he just telephoned us not to wait for him he has to sign some papers of some sort three would be deadly and madame suggested that i ask you selden s heart was beating like a drum it was the rubicon where is the dinner he asked in a voice muffled by emotion in madame s apartment here in the hotel third floor will you come please come m selden said madame s voice softly it was all over he took the plunge of course i will come he said thank madame for me oh you can thank her yourself said davis with a chuckle we will give you fifteen minutes all right selden agreed and placed the receiver back on its rack he gave a last critical look at himself retied his tie then caught up coat and hat descended to the lobby and hurried out to the florist s at the corner where he bought two preposterously expensive bunches of roses he paid for them with a thrill of satisfaction for the first time in his life he was being foolish he had cut loose from the moorings of common sense he had let himself go flowers in hand he hurried back to the hotel and presented himself at the door of madame ghita s apartment he was entirely cool now quite himself and was able to present the flowers to the ladies and exchange the usual greetings without a tremor only he suspected an uncanny discernment in the long look madame ghita gave him as she thanked him for the roses she was looking incredibly lovely in a clinging gown of dark wine coloured velvet without ornamentation and as she moved away from him to place the roses in a vase and order dinner to be served he drank in again the exquisite grace of her figure the queenly pose of her head the regal way in which she moved and a sudden shaft of fear struck through him how could he hope to win a woman like that she came back in a moment and motioned them to table let us sit down she said you here at my left m selden you at my right m davis you there cicette as they took their seats selden saw that she had placed one of his roses in her bosom and his hands began to tremble a little in spite of his efforts to control them he was grateful that davis was babbling away excitedly it was great for you to come old man he said perfectly gorgeous imagine a dinner with an empty place selden chilled at the words yes it was true he was there in another man s place this apartment was another man s apartment this woman he had an impulse to rise to run away it was not at table only he was seeking to take another man s place the thought was almost more than he could bear i had a premonition the place would be empty unless m selden consented to come said madame ghita softly davis stared at her but you were doubtful if he would i knew that m selden had many engagements said madame her colour mounting a little nevertheless i permitted myself to hope selden felt his heart revive so the place was really his you are very good to me madame he murmured and then he caught cicette s eyes on him very round and shining well let the whole world see he did not care but davis was too engrossed in his own affairs to notice anything i told you you know he rattled on that this was a very special occasion confound it i can t keep it any longer he added as cicette made a motion to silence him and he caught her hand and held it waiter fill the glasses selden old man i want you to drink to the health of the sweetest girl in the world the future madame davis and he raised cicette s hand to his lips with more grace than selden imagined he possessed with all my heart cried selden deeply moved i congratulate you davis and you also mademoiselle thank you said davis and held out his hand across the board you said that as though you meant to do it i do mean it she is charming she will make you a good wife take care that you make her a good husband at that the bride to be gave him her hand to kiss you also are very charming she said in rapid french and i hope that some day it will be my turn to wish you good fortune she glanced at madame ghita s face and suddenly sprang to her feet and ran around the table and kissed her you are a darling she whispered in her ear a big big darling the dearest of the world madame held her close for a moment and then sent her back to her seat you must be sensible she said oh yes i shall be sensible do not fear miss fayard assured her and i shall try to be as you say monsieur a good wife but he has need of control has he not a strong hand hein truly agreed selden a very strong hand do not hesitate to apply it mademoiselle right from the beginning see here protested davis don t talk so fast or speak english i also learn ze eengleesh laughed miss fayard oh already i spik heem verree well but ees eet not ridicule ce nom la madame davees well it is going to be yours said davis grimly so you ll have to make the best of it you understand he went on to selden this is between ourselves as yet we ve got to square things with mother before it s announced she will never consent never cried miss fayard lapsing into her native tongue oh yes she will said davis old selden has promised to help me and if she doesn t it won t make any difference i m of age we won t starve selden looked at him with interest already he detected in him a new spirit he was more of a man yes i will help he said but whether your mother consents or not you were right not to wait there is a very great english poet he went on to madame ghita named robert browning perhaps you have heard of him and he was a great poet because he was first of all a great philosopher one of his poems is about a man who loved the wife of another man and she also loved him and they decided to go away together and be happy but first one thing intervened and then another the days slipped by and the months and the years before they knew it age was upon them their blood grew cold it was too late yes and then asked madame ghita who had been listening with shining eyes browning points out that their indecision their cowardice was far worse far more damning than if they had seized their happiness though that was a crime and he adds that a man should contend to the uttermost for his life s set prize be it what it will vice or virtue for the worst sin of all is the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin and he is right said madame in a low voice of course he is right that is why i tell davis he is wise to seize his happiness while it is within reach whether his mother consents or not that does not matter is it true then monsieur asked the girl who had been listening to all this with great eyes that in america one can marry without the consent of the parents but yes selden assured her with us it makes no difference whether or not the parents consent many times they do not even know about it until after their children are married it is scarcely to be believed america mademoiselle said selden whose spirit had suddenly lifted its wings within him is the land of youth for youth about youth we are young we permit our young people to tyrannize over us our literature our theatre concerns itself only with their love affairs which are always innocent and always end in a happy marriage and in that marriage it is always the woman who dominates the man is tolerated because to a marriage a man is necessary but he has only one function to provide a pedestal upon which the woman may stand and but one duty to worship her all his life he has promised to do so and he must keep that promise no matter how silly and useless he may find her to be that is the convention the proper thing to which all good americans subscribe i know i know cried cicette i have seen them the man following his wife like a footman a beast of burden yes said selden laughing it is only in america the woman walks in front but there is one thing i cannot understand went on cicette that there are so many american women who leave their husbands at home when they come to europe why not selden demanded what need has the husband of culture or relaxation his function is to earn the living but is it not dangerous those deserted husbands do they not find some one some of them do but most of them just keep on toiling away the american husband is incredibly docile and incredibly faithful so i do well to marry an american undoubtedly and he does well to marry a frenchwoman said madame ghita for in spite of her gay manner in spite of her apparent thoughtlessness she is good and very serious at bottom she will give herself to her husband utterly without reservation she will live only for his career she will be ceaselessly vigilant for his interests if he is ill she will nurse him if he has bad fortune she will console him she will herself prepare the dishes he likes to eat happy to serve him yes agreed selden men are more precious over here more cherished you have always had more women than men with us as with every frontier nation it has been the other way and we still preserve the frontier tradition it is the women who are at a premium it is deeper than that protested madame it is in the heart we also have women like that said selden quietly women who would do anything for the man they love you do not see them over here not often they are too busy raising their children they do not figure in the papers for their life is spent in their homes only they demand more of a man than you do they do not realize what half tamed creatures we are and sometimes they demand too much i think you understand men better ah yes laughed miss fayard shaking her finger at davis we understand them never believe that i will not understand you when you lie to me i shall know it but you will never suspect that i know not until long long afterwards and then you will be very very much ashamed all right said davis gazing at her in rapt adoration i am not afraid isn t she a peach he added to selden exquisite selden agreed suddenly sober be good to her old man you don t need to tell me that said davis quickly perhaps not what are you going to do after you are married we re going to take a trip around the world yes and after that oh settle down somewhere i guess and raise a family that will keep your wife busy but not you what are you going to do he will be a great politician cried cicette davis groaned not in america he is right said selden with a smile with us it is not the same thing well you must choose a career for him mademoiselle after you know him better something to keep him busy part of the time so that he won t be annoying you all day long i wish i had some one to choose a career for me he added madame ghita looked at him quickly struck by something in his voice you have your career she said a very wonderful one do you think so but of course every one thinks so she was looking at him searchingly now deeply concerned at what she saw in his face do you mean it does not satisfy you it seems rather empty at times he confessed empty but how is that possible oh you are jesting i wish a sudden commotion at the outer door interrupted him the sound of a raised voice and then the curtains were swept aside and danilo burst into the room i have come for you renee he cried with a wild gesture hasten i take you away to night a woman s decision there was a moment s stupefied silence while the prince looked triumphantly at each of them in turn his gaze lingering upon selden an instant longer than upon the others as though asking what he did there his eyes were shining strangely and there was something defiant in his face something reckless in his air as of a man who had started forth upon some desperate venture and burned his boats behind him come he said again as madame ghita made no move but i do not understand she protested i have had enough of it said the prince and he filled himself a glass of champagne and gulped it down i am treated as of no importance as just a pawn in a game which does not interest me i am told to do this not to do that to marry a woman for whom i care nothing that would not be so bad it was what i expected to that i have agreed but to leave the woman i love no to that i did not agree and when they tell me i must do it i say no it is not possible it is asking too much i rebel yes i thrust it all aside and i come to take you away madame ghita s face was ghastly but the dynasty your grandfather it will kill him she said in a voice hoarse with emotion i cannot help it that is no reason why i should be miserable all my life and your country jeneski will rule it better than i come what is it he demanded seeing that she still stared at him as though fascinated and made no move what is it you fear that i have no money see here and he plunged his hand into his pocket and brought forth a bulky purse i have three hundred thousand francs enough for two years where did you get it she asked no matter where i got it he cried and a little spasm crossed his face distorting it for an instant i have it that is enough come no no she protested no no you cannot do this look here put in davis who had caught the drift of things what about my sister your sister will be far happier if she does not marry me said the prince i am not in the least the man for her still protested davis to be deserted like this she may make any explanation she pleases that it was she who broke off the match and i will confirm it i have no wish to injure your sister monsieur and she will not be injured just the same davis muttered it s pretty tough that it should happen twice if monsieur wishes any other satisfaction said the prince haughtily i am at his service then he swung back to madame ghita alors renee the blood was coming back into her face and she was regaining her self control sit down danilo she said and do not be so ridiculous one cannot go away like that what about my packing your maid can do it and you you are going away like that with just the clothes you have on my man will send my things after me no she said you are too silly you must keep your word to this girl but you told me to day that when i marry her everything is over between us yes everything is over between us now danilo she said gently his face flushed a fiery red and he strode toward her threateningly then it is not because of this marriage that you leave me it is because you no longer love me she made no answer only looked at him smiling slightly a bright spot of colour in either cheek you love some one else he shouted who is it and his eyes roved for an instant back to selden s face ah danilo she said sadly do not spoil everything at the end in this way do not make me regret that i have known you then it is true who is it monsieur said madame ghita coldly i am not to be shouted at even by you you are not yourself to night if you are going to behave in this manner i must ask you to withdraw for an instant selden tense and ready to spring thought the prince was going to strike her withdraw he repeated staring at her and then about the apartment as though doubting his own senses you tell me to withdraw and then he burst into a roar of laughter pulled up a chair and sat down come he said lighting a cigarette with trembling hand it is over i was a fool hein what a joke give me some wine davis much relieved filled his glass do you often have these fits he asked not often monsieur said the prince drily sipping his wine madame there can testify that i am usually of the most equable but sometimes yes sometimes i think i am a little mad and he rubbed his hand across his forehead yet we are all of us a little mad are we not m selden and he looked at selden with a sardonic smile some more than others selden answered ah you mean me said the prince yes it is so i more than others sometimes i am quite quite mad to night par example i thought i had discovered a way of escape from all the things that worried me that was mad yes because one can never escape you are right selden agreed one can never escape not by running away i see what you mean and the prince nodded to overcome one s troubles one must not run away one must face them yes besides it is cowardly to run away and a gentleman must not be a coward you see i can be a philosopher at times i am at this moment very philosophique i remain i face my troubles monsieur davis you will yet have me for a beau frere madame i ask your pardon it is granted she said i am happy to see you reasonable again yes i am reasonable he agreed another glass madame who had been watching him with evident anxiety shook her head but davis did not see the gesture and filled the glass wait said davis and refilled all the glasses you remember i told you that i had a surprise for you to night ah yes smiled the prince what is it it is that i am going to marry miss fayard answered davis unconsciously falling into his idiom this is my betrothal dinner is it true cried the prince and sprang to his feet monsieur madame let us drink to the happy pair to their health to their happiness to everything that is good he drained his glass then walked around the table and took the girl s hand mademoiselle he said i have always admired you for you are good i pray you to accept this little gift for good luck and he drew a ring from his finger and slipped it upon hers then kissed her hand and released it it is beautiful she cried holding it to the light but it is your good luck ring you should not give me your good luck ring i shall not need it any more he said as pere de famille i shall not tempt fortune i shall just grow fat and lazy he drew his coat about him you are going asked madame yes i must be getting back but is it true danilo that you have all that money in your purse yes it is true it is very foolish and very dangerous dangerous in monte carlo where one meets a gendarme at every ten steps besides do not worry i shall place it in the bank as soon as possible unless have you need of some and he thrust his hand in his pocket ah no she said quickly with a gesture of repugnance it is yours if you want it he persisted his hand still in his pocket a strange smile on his lips i do not want it she answered quietly then good night said the prince you have been very good to me madame i shall never forget it and shall wish you happiness always and you monsieur he continued to selden i regret that it has not been my privilege to know you better i feel that we might have been friends but i wish you all good fortune he hesitated his eyes on selden s as though debating whether to say something more then with a little shake of the head turned to miss fayard and to you mademoiselle again i say good luck i am sure you will bring good luck to others how old are you he added as though struck by a sudden thought i am nineteen m le prince nineteen a good age a lucky age he said and kissed her hand and you m davis but i do not need to wish you good fortune you have it there and he nodded toward the girl do not worry my friend i will do my best to make your sister happy i can promise at least not to annoy her good bye and with a wave of his hat he was gone they all sat for a moment without speaking staring at the door through which he had vanished then davis reached for his glass yes he is mad he gulped but what does he mean going away like that he he frightens me again there was a moment s silence perhaps he frightened all of them madame ghita touched her eyes gently with her handkerchief he reminds me of a man about to go over the top said selden pensively in a sort of ecstasy i have seen them like that many times as they stood waiting for the word yes cried miss fayard with a catch in her throat the word to go forward to their death it is not always death said selden gently his heart very tender for the lovely sad woman beside him sometimes it is victory the prince plays they still tell at the sporting club of the last visit of prince danilo there have been other visits more spectacular ending with a pistol shot on the terrace or a draught of poison in the wash room but of them no one speaks there have been many persons who won more or lost more and were promptly forgotten but there was something about the prince that night an air of mystery and unreality which the onlookers never forgot and his style was so exquisite his bearing so perfect that they have ever since served as a model by which the attendants measure each new aspirant for the honours of the rooms and all are agreed that they have never been approached that visit indeed has not only been remembered but is rapidly passing into legend already it has been richly embroidered and reasons the most fanciful have been advanced as to why the prince chose to play a certain number or why he chose to play at all and dazzling stories have been woven of what would have happened if he had played at any other table in the room instead of the one he actually selected all of which is of course inevitable because the great diversion of the habitues of monte carlo aside from trying to devise a system to beat the bank is explaining what would have happened if how many times daily the bank would be broken but for that little word as a matter of fact when the prince left the hotel de paris he probably did not expect to play at all for he asked the giant be medalled negro who keeps the door to call his car the negro explained respectfully that it was his infinite regret to be obliged to inform m le prince that a slight accident had happened to the car a careless chauffeur in turning had backed into it and damaged the front axle slightly already it was being straightened in the hotel garage and would be ready in twenty minutes if m le prince wished another car no said the prince i will wait and he walked slowly down to the terrace and stood for a moment looking out to sea a gardien saw and recognized him and saluted respectfully as he passed he might have stood there until the car was ready but for a violent gust of rain which swept suddenly in from the sea and drove him back up the steps at the top he hesitated the lights of the sporting club gleamed on his left and at last he turned slowly toward them perhaps it was in his mind that since the goddess of fortune had dealt him one staggering blow that night she might now like a true woman relent and smile upon him at any rate he mounted the steps to the entrance and passed in the rooms were crowded as always and all the tables were in play but he passed through without pausing or looking at any one and walked on into the buffet where he ordered a whiskey and soda and drank it standing at the bar then as though his resolution was taken he walked quickly back into the gaming rooms stopped at the nearest table changed a thousand franc note for ten plaques and placed them around the number nineteen the chef de partie sitting in his high chair behind the croupiers and surveying the whole board must have sensed something unusual in the prince s manner for he watched him intently but no one else paid any attention to him every one was absorbed in the play an attendant asked him if he wished a chair but he shook his head and remained standing faites vos jeux messieurs faites vos jeux called the croupier and bets were placed up and down the board but the prince alone was on nineteen les jeux sont faits and the croupier leaned forward picked the little ivory ball out of the compartment into which it had fallen the previous play gently reversed the motion of the wheel and with a quick snap of his middle finger sent the ball circling around and around the cupped rim of the wheel around and around six times seven times eight times and then its pace began to slacken rien ne va plus called the croupier sharply and the ball fell with a rattle into the middle of the wheel coasted up its raised centre hesitated for the merest instant and settled with a quick snap into one of the compartments le dix neuf announced the croupier rouge impair et passe breaths that had been held were released and there was a murmur of voices lamenting that they had not been on nineteen for the prince had won it was not very much perhaps fifteen thousand francs but he seemed to regard it as a sign for he too took a quick breath and nodded to an attendant who hastened to find a chair for him the prince sat down placed his winnings in front of him and began to play with absorbed attention always on or around or in connection with the number nineteen there have been many stories of desperate persons who risked an entire fortune on a single turn of the wheel and lost or of lucky individuals who won enormous sums by permitting their stakes to accumulate as the same number came out again and again neither of these things is possible for the bank sets arbitrary limits to the play running from a hundred and eighty francs on a number which pays thirty five for one to six thousand francs on the simple chances odd or even red or black high or low which wins an equal amount so that if one plays the maximum on all the chances it is possible though rather difficult to lose about thirty thousand francs or to win a little over a hundred thousand but that is the limit so the prince playing cautiously and confining himself at first to the cheveaux and carres took a long time in losing the fifteen thousand francs he had won even though nineteen did not come again twenty seventeen and twenty three came which helped to recoup his losses and it was at least an hour after he had sat down that the last of his fifteen thousand francs were swept away he glanced at his watch and made a motion as if to rise then decided to wait for the next play the ball fell into nineteen there was an outcry of sympathy and indignation on the part of the spectators what a shame what a crime that his number should come at the very moment he had ceased playing quietly as though moved by some power stronger than himself the prince drew his purse from his pocket opened it and laid it on the table before him and this time he staked the maximum it is not often that any one stakes the maximum at monte carlo even in this day thirty thousand francs is a considerable sum so an electric whisper ran around the room that something unusual was going forward at the prince s table and the crowd around it became thicker and thicker the chef de partie scenting a battle royal sent hastily to the cashier for an extra supply of funds the hand of the croupier was perhaps a shade less steady than usual as he picked up the marble and started it on its run it spun faltered rattled clicked the twenty seven announced the croupier red odd and low the prince had won six thousand and lost twenty four imperturbably he placed his bets again it was at this moment that selden entered the room the prince s abrupt departure had left a constraint upon the dinner party which was not to be shaken off they had gone from the dining room into the salon and there after one or two ineffectual attempts at gaiety davis and his fiancee had withdrawn to a corner sofa to discuss certain strictly intimate affairs and selden had smoked a cigarette with madame ghita and talked of desultory and unimportant things of anything indeed except the one thing which had been in his mind to say when he was buying the roses impossible to say that now impossible even to hint at it it would be indecent like wooing a woman whose husband was dying in the next room besides she was in no mood for such confidences she was distrait and sad the conversation faltered and died away and presently he summoned up courage to take his departure she had been obviously grateful that he should go he was too depressed and agitated to think of sleep so he slipped into his coat left the hotel and descended to the terrace just as the prince had done half an hour before the rain squall earlier in the evening had swept the terrace bare and he found himself alone there except for the gardien masses of slaty clouds were fleeing across the sky before the gusty wind with the moon peeping between them now and then and sending fugitive gleams of light over the white capped waves which hissed and moaned dolefully as they were driven in upon the rocky shore more doleful still was the rustle of the palms and the clatter of the rubber trees flapping in the wind like a flock of ghostly night birds and above him gleamed the lights of the casino standing like a courtesan white and gilt and laboriously gay but at heart most dismal of all selden gave himself up for a time to the luxury of self pity to that most dangerous of all dissipations a fit of the blues what was the use of going on what was the use of having ideals or of fighting for them the world paid no heed what indeed was the world but a huge casino where every one was struggling to win his neighbour s gold why above all should he worry himself about a woman who was sad because another man was leaving her but here his sense of justice asserted itself the man was not leaving her she was sending him away he had come seeking her and she had refused to go she had made her choice but how could she help being sad at the thought that one epoch of her life was ended she had lived with this man in closest intimacy he had no doubt been kind and generous he had loved her at the end he had come offering everything he had and she had sent him away where had he gone a sudden thought startled selden out of his moodiness what had the prince meant when he promised to give his money to the bank why had he smiled so ironically which bank in a moment selden was hurrying toward the sporting club and the instant he entered the rooms he knew that his suspicion was correct that dense crowd around a single table could mean only one thing somebody was playing the limit he is playing nineteen always nineteen said a man beside him to his neighbour nineteen then of course it was the prince it was some time before selden could get near enough to see what was going on but meanwhile the marble had been spun twice and he heard the croupier announce two and eleven then he managed to worm himself into a position from which he could see the prince danilo seemed entirely cool nonchalant listless even he was smoking a cigarette and tossing his notes into place upon the board as though they were so many bits of worthless paper he appeared equally indifferent as to whether he won or lost and totally unconscious of the gaping crowd that watched him selden recognized in his bearing the cold fury of the confirmed gambler which stops at nothing there had been in his head the idea that he might intervene but he saw that it was useless to speak to the prince now would be to insult him the thirty five announced the croupier black odd and low well that was not so bad six thousand on low and six on odd but the next number was six and the board was swept clear again the prince proceeded calmly to renew his bets nineteen must come sometime selden told himself if it came once the prince would win back all he had lost if it came twice he would be a hundred thousand francs ahead sixteen that was good thirty thousand francs nearly a gain but the next numbers were fifteen thirty three three and again six and the prince had lost another hundred thousand nobody else was playing it was a battle between the prince and the bank m le directeur des jeux had come out from his little office to watch it and to take command if necessary the prince lighted another cigarette and placed his money again nineteen there was a little cheer from the crowd as the croupier counted out the various bets one after the other and pushed the notes across to the prince again now and every one pulled for nineteen as the little ball spun gaily around but it fell into eight and again the board was swept clean that was the beginning of a bad run six there was a fatality about that six eight again thirty three twelve two twenty four a little gain there fifteen and then there was a short rally sixteen twenty twenty three but never again nineteen then another bad run and the pile of notes under the prince s hand diminished rapidly he did not hesitate always nineteen the crowd was beginning to get impatient with him why nineteen why keep it up when he saw it was not a good number and as if to mock him the croupier at the next table could be heard announcing nineteen but certainly he should change if not the number then the table it was imbecile to keep on like that but the prince did not change it was nearly two o clock when he finally put his empty purse away and rose to his feet messieurs he said with a little bow to the directeur and the chef de partie i have to thank you for a very pleasant evening and he walked calmly to the door got his hat and coat from the vestiaire and went out into the night an affair of state selden took train for nice next morning with a sense of impending calamity he was greatly depressed the emotional events of the previous evening had overtaxed his nerves he had slept badly disturbed by elusively threatening dreams and his brain was muggy and distraught he was almost sorry he had not heeded his impulse to run away to leave his lamp unlit he doubted more and more whether its feeble rays would ever guide him out of the labyrinth in which he was madly wandering and from which there seemed to be no way of escape the train he had caught was a local and as it bumped its leisurely way along he had time to review his position over a contemplative pipe but the more he considered it the worse it seemed to grow turn it as he might he could discover no bright side of one thing only he was certain his life would never again be the calm and satisfactory thing it had been a few days had changed it beyond recognition it was no longer simple it was incredibly complex he could scarcely believe that only eighty hours had elapsed since he had walked into the lounge of the hotel de paris to meet the countess remond at nice the passengers were hurried across the tracks for the rome paris express had been signalled and as he gave up his ticket to the guard at the exit selden s eye caught a familiar figure it was halsey walking nervously up and down in the waiting room pausing now and then to watch the people pouring from the train shed his eyes met selden s for an instant but he gave no sign of recognition he was rather a pitiable figure his face grey and drawn his eyes shot with blood evidently his affair with the countess was not progressing smoothly well he was only getting what he deserved selden told himself as he turned away it still lacked fifteen minutes of the hour named by the baron so deciding that the walk would do him good selden turned briskly down the avenue des victoires toward the sea the street was swarming as usual with tourists and winter residents whose presence there was always an insoluble mystery to selden he never could understand why any one would want to spend a winter at nice when there were so many other places up and down the coast infinitely more attractive it was the herd instinct he decided which brought these thousands of people here to spend their vacations in an inordinately expensive hotel or a dingy pension with nothing to do except walk up and down the promenade des anglais or look sadly on at the laboriously manufactured gaieties he found the promenade a solid mass of people moving in two slow currents one up one down for this was the fashionable hour to get out and take the sun and exhibit one s new gown which some man somewhere had somehow procured the money for truly human nature is a curious thing the gates of the villa gloria were open and he walked through past the concierge who recognized him and touched his cap up the path to the door where a waiting attendant received him and ushered him at once into the salon the king and lappo were already there and greeted him warmly then the baron introduced him to the notary m noblemaire a true type with hawk nose crinkly beard and carefully brushed clothes of rusty black who with an assistant was going over the papers to make sure that everything was in order the prince came in a moment later greeted selden casually and sat down beside the long table which occupied the centre of the room he was dressed in irreproachable morning costume and save for a slight pallor gave no hint in his appearance of his exciting experiences of the night before no one looking at him would have suspected that he had lost a fortune selden was conscious of a great relief for he had expected he knew not what some excitement some discomposure at least some vestige of wreckage after the storm certainly the prince had consummate self control then the door opened and mrs davis and her daughter were shown in the former very warm and voluble the latter as composed as the prince himself nothing could have been more delicate more exquisitely attuned to the situation than the way in which danilo greeted her respectful reserved but with just a hint of ardency beneath the surface from the quick glance she shot at the prince s face selden inferred the manner was new to her but it was evidently not distasteful and as he turned away to meet mrs davis who was bearing down upon him he saw that the baron was contemplating it with satisfaction the prince had been tamed he was playing the game and playing it extraordinarily well how do you do mr selden cried mrs davis it was too good of you to consent to be our witness i should not have dared to ask but the dear baron assured me that you were very good natured miss davis came forward and gave him her hand it was nice of you she said and it relieves my mind relieves your mind she smiled a little at his tone i regard it as the seal of your approval she explained do you still need the seal of my approval he asked it is very comforting to have it that is what your being here means isn t it i suppose so but you must remember that i am looking at it from the outside while you i know what you mean she said as he hesitated there is no reason why you should beat around the bush i am not a child of course but it has bothered me it needn t bother you any longer it is all right i had a letter from her this morning a very splendid letter some day i should like to know her mrs davis to whom m noblemaire had been presented was announcing that charley had stopped for their notary since it was necessary they have their own notary but surely madame said m noblemaire who had some english otherwise it would be most irregular well so charley had gone around for him and should arrive at any moment and sure enough at that moment charley did arrive with another notary in tow the two men of the robe greeted each other with punctilious politeness to look at them no one would have suspected that they played dominoes together every evening at the cafe on the corner we are all here i think said the king and took his place at the head of the table baron lappo conducted miss davis and her mother to the seats at the king s right the prince took his place at his grandfather s left and their partisans ranged themselves on either side below them selden found himself near the foot of the table facing m noblemaire s assistant for some minutes there was a great rustling of papers on the part of the notaries then they bent their heads together across the table in earnest conversation while m noblemaire explained two or three of the clauses to his colleague who seemed to be objecting to something as a matter of form no doubt to give the appearance of earning his fee but who finally nodded his head as though satisfied and settled back in his chair then m noblemaire cleared his throat and rose to his feet mesdames et messieurs he began speaking in french with a pronounced accent of the midi and dwelling upon every syllable after the manner of an orator we have come here to day to sign and to acknowledge certain articles of agreement between the royal house of ghita and the american family davis which envisage the marriage of a prince of that house with a daughter of that family with your permission i will proceed to read those articles he adjusted his glasses and began to read with great care and solemnity while his fellow notary followed on a duplicate copy checking off the articles one by one selden listened with deep interest he was gratified to hear the baron s assertion verified miss davis s fortune was to remain absolutely in her hands and was to descend to her children the necessity of children was recognized quite frankly and their status rights and privileges were provided for in great detail during the lifetime of the king he was to be their guardian jointly with their mother after his death this duty was to devolve upon the baron lappo the prince was to have a yearly allowance of two hundred thousand francs and his present debts were to be paid in return he engaged to reside within the borders of his country for ten months of every year unless his presence elsewhere was necessitated by reasons of state approved by the king selden glanced up and down the board as noblemaire read slowly on the king and lappo were listening attentively careful to let no word escape them the prince sat with arms folded and eyes downcast and face inexpressive like a prisoner listening while sentence was pronounced miss davis sat quietly attentive her hands folded in her lap her attitude seemed to say that since this document concerned her so closely it behooved her to be familiar with all its provisions but it was a matter of business not of sentiment selden recalled the baron s words about her was it really some old trial some cruel disillusion which had given her this serene self control had she really suffered some disastrous adventure it scarcely seemed possible and then selden remembered a sentence which her brother had uttered apparently at random the night before it had passed unheeded then but selden found that it had somehow stuck in his memory what was it he had said it s pretty tough that it should happen twice something like that that what should happen twice that she should be twice deserted for another woman was it that old affair with jeneski he referred to had jeneski deserted her for another woman the countess remond but the countess remond hated him too she also was seeking to be revenged and suddenly the pieces of the puzzle fell together in his mind like the bits of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope and he understood jeneski was to be overthrown because two women hated him the destiny of a people was to be changed the course of history altered to gratify their vengeance ah well that had happened a thousand times women were always altering the course of history to suit their whims or their passions damming it up throwing it into strange channels or perhaps it was only his too fervid imagination magnifying a chance remark myra davis certainly did not look like a girl to seek adventure to court disaster at any rate whether or not she had been deserted once she was not being deserted twice presently she would be a princess and after that queen regent her son would be a king the first king in history to be born of an american woman that also would alter its course m noblemaire s voice droned on and each of them sat and listened and dreamed his dream and mrs davis s perhaps was the sweetest of all of a place on the steps of a throne then suddenly the voice ceased and startled them awake you find it correct i trust monsieur inquired m noblemaire of his fellow notary yes monsieur in every detail then we have only to sign said m noblemaire and turned to his assistant for the pens ink and blotter selden was amused to see that the pens were long quills m noblemaire dipped one of them in the ink picked up the paper and approached the king if you will sign here your majesty he said and laid the paper before him indicated the place and handed him the pen the king scrawled a great pietro across the page it was the prince s turn next and the baron witnessed the signatures now mademoiselle said m noblemaire and laid the document in front of miss davis she took the pen from him with a hand that shook a little no no cried a voice outside it is impossible monsieur you cannot enter monsieur but i must enter cried another voice and the door was thrown open with a crash the course of history for a moment no one stirred just sat and stared at the man who came swift and resolute into the room while the frightened attendant goggled from the door behind him a man of perhaps forty with dark vivid face outlined by a little beard and a mop of black hair falling over his forehead and deep set eyes gleaming under heavy brows a man with a bearing indescribably confident and audacious just sat and stared as he advanced quickly to the table bowed to selden and to the baron lappo and then went straight to myra davis took her hand dashing to the floor the pen he found in it and drew her to her feet against his breast little one he said i have come for you but she held him away from her held him away with arms trembling and convulsive but inflexible and there was something like terror in her eyes as she looked at him no no she gasped you are horrible to come here like this i love you it is too late it is not too late why is it too late because i do not love you any more no he asked calmly without any motion to release her of course in that case but by this time the king was on his feet his face purple what is this farce he roared jacopo mario throw this fellow out one moment sir said the stranger perhaps the baron lappo will do me the honour to present me and the baron lappo his face a study rose in his turn your majesty he said this is m jeneski jeneski selden of course had recognized him and mrs davis too apparently from the energy with which she now rushed forward rescued her daughter from his grasp and tried to kill him with a look but to the king it was undoubtedly a blow and for an instant his hand fumbled at his breast yet not for nothing had the old warrior reigned for sixty years in the midst of hate and violence and his composure was back in a moment he signed to jacopo to close the door m jeneski he said with a bow i have often wished to meet you i must apologize for my abrupt entrance sir said jeneski smiling his appreciation of the king s aplomb but i feared that i should be too late too late for what sir asked the king too late for this ceremony explained jeneski with a gesture toward the papers on the table ah said the king you wish to witness it i wish to prevent it corrected jeneski quietly the king wrinkled his brow incredulously and his colour heightened a little really he began believe me sir said jeneski quickly i deeply regret this violent and dramatic procedure i assure you that it is not at all in my character but i had no choice i have strained every nerve to reach here at the earliest possible moment i should have arrived last night but was delayed by a series of misadventures which i will not weary you by reciting so when twenty minutes ago at the villa of madame davis i learned of this conference i could only hasten here and force my way in you may as well force your way out again broke in mrs davis who had listened to all this with a face even redder than the king s if you think for a minute my daughter will have anything to do with you hush mother whispered the girl her face convulsed i confess said the king politely that i do not understand is it that you profess to have some claim upon this young lady only the claim of a man who loves her said jeneski humbly love began mrs davis violently but again her daughter stopped her i am at a very great disadvantage went on jeneski it is very difficult to speak to explain to say what i have to say thus publicly if i for one moment might see miss davis alone never cried her mother his eyes implored the girl but she turned her face away very well he said and drew close to her side i must speak to you then little one as though we were alone forget that there is any one present but you and me his voice was trembling with emotion he paused an instant to collect himself and moistened his lips nervously before i say anything else i must say this for the wrong i did you in a moment of madness i have suffered much perhaps if you knew the whole story but no there is no excuse i say to you only that i have suffered that i have done great penance all that was torn out of my life and cast aside many months ago since then i have thought only of my country and of you the baron can tell you that this is true since he has used that old affair to secure an accomplice in the plot against me she was staring at him with wide open eyes white to the lips her hands pressed against her heart he made no motion to touch her but his eyes never wavered from hers even then he went on rapidly i would not have dreamed of coming near you no not yet i would have worked on for my country and cleansed myself with sacrifice loving you always and hoping that some day you might find me worthy but this this alliance it must not be do you know what you are doing you are riveting again on half a million people the shackles they have just thrown off after a struggle of two centuries we are willing to leave it to the people themselves sir put in the baron quietly ah yes cried jeneski after you have corrupted them with i know not what promises of course they will choose the easy way well then said the baron they are not fit to choose not yet let them learn first what freedom means come i ask nothing for myself nothing he went on turning back to the girl i have no right to ask anything for myself do i not know it yes better than any one but for my country i do ask i have the right to ask not much only this that you delay this marriage for a year for six months even then leave it to the people he had raised his arms in his excitement and as he brought them down with an impassioned gesture there was a spatter of blood across the papers on the table and a steady drip drip from under his sleeve and across his left hand to the floor he seized his left arm near the shoulder and held it tight what is that asked myra davis taking a quick step toward him are you hurt it is nothing said jeneski impatiently less than nothing just one of the misadventures which delayed me then a little smile flitted across his lips and he looked at the baron i confess however that i did not suppose the baron lappo would descend to methods so so primitive what do you mean sir demanded the baron was it not you asked jeneski still smiling who posted that big englishman on the platform up yonder to shoot me as i left the train the baron s face was livid m jeneski he began i swear to you it was not the baron put in selden quickly it was the countess remond i knew she was driving halsey on to something but i never guessed ah well i should have guessed said jeneski i apologize to you m le baron after all it is nothing a scratch across the arm i had time to bandage it but hastily so it bleeds a little i am sorry there was a moment s pause then myra davis released herself from her mother s grasp and turned to baron lappo is it true she asked what he said about that that affair yes mademoiselle answered the baron grimly it is true the colour had come back into her face and her eyes were shining and is it true that you have suffered she asked of jeneski he made a little motion with his hands more expressive than any words i have suffered too she said simply oh my love said jeneski humbly some day i hope you will find it in your heart to pardon me she stood yet an instant looking at him then she held out her hands i pardon you now she said it was over the davises were gone and selden too had tried to go but the baron had asked him to remain the king had behaved magnificently well he knew the folly of trying to argue with a woman s heart and he had uttered no word of disappointment or reproach instead having thrown and lost he took defeat like a sportsman and a gentleman faced ruin exile tragic failure with a smile had even wished her happiness and kissed her hand in farewell with jeneski he had been almost cordial selden had never admired him so much though he told himself it was this very habit of dissimulation which rendered the king least admirable perhaps he had not yet lost hope some fanatic with a better aim than poor fuddled halsey might take a shot at jeneski or there was the countess herself presumably raging somewhere at the failure of her plot there was still that possible alliance between young davis and the princess anna finally there was always that huge sum which had been offered for his abdication which he had once refused but which he could still accept whenever it seemed wise and upon which he could live comfortably for the remainder of his life no doubt it was such considerations as these which enabled the king to bear up so well selden was surprised to note that danilo seemed far more deeply affected he was like a man stunned slouched forward in his chair staring at the papers with the dash of blood across them his face ghastly in its pallor we must consider said the baron how best to announce this to the world m selden i am sure will not wish to do us any unnecessary injury certainly not said selden i shall use only the official version i will not conceal from you went on the baron that this debacle i think i can call it has left us in a somewhat delicate position we had made certain financial arrangements based on this alliance which will have to be cancelled or at least reconsidered fortunately he hesitated glancing at the king yes the king nodded i have not touched the money since i placed it in my bureau last night it can be returned if hirsch demands it it is that fact alone the baron pointed out which saves us from the most painful embarrassment the prince stirred uneasily passed his hand across his haggard forehead and rose unsteadily to his feet you will excuse me he said the king nodded and the prince went slowly out i did not suppose it would be such a blow to him said the king as the door closed behind danilo i do not understand it unless he has been losing again but he has no money no agreed the baron and i know of no way he could secure any selden managed to keep an impassive face but he was smiling inwardly evidently the prince had sources of supply unknown to the baron whatever it is said the king let us hope it will make him more serious continue baron the baron paced up and down for a moment his chin in his hand of course she will marry jeneski he said at last and glanced at his master yes i understand lappo said the king quietly you would say that it is finished that the game is up well we shall see i have confidence in my star at least what was that from somewhere in the house had come a muffled report as of a door slamming or a pistol shot a sudden pallor swept over the king s face danilo he cried and started to rise then sank back clutching at his breast danilo but danilo lay sprawled across his bed a bullet through his heart he had managed to escape after all epilogue a last encounter since this is our last night in paris said selden looking up from his paper we ought to celebrate it what shall we do the opera replied renee instantly let me see what it is and she took the paper away from him it was samson and delila and the curtain is at eight she added we must hurry they were there when the curtain rose and were soon under the spell of the enchanting music with which saint saens has clothed the old scripture allegory of man s weakness and woman s perfidy a drama which is re enacted daily wherever men and women live and so touches a chord in every heart surely no lovelier song was ever written than delila s mon coeur s ouvre a ta voix comme s ouvrent les fleurs aux baisers de l aurore my heart opens at thy voice as the flowers open to the kisses of the dawn and no more effective scene was ever staged than that of the blinded samson chained like a beast to the mill and pushing it round and round so the great drama swept on to the supreme moment when samson praying for strength bends his back between the mighty pillars of the temple and brings it crashing down upon the heads of his enemies there was to be a ballet afterwards to a chopin suite and when selden and his companion came back from a turn in the foyer they found that the front row of the orchestra which had been empty during the opera was filling up with distinguished looking old men most of them with the rosette of the legion gleaming red on their coats renee nodded toward them with a smile you see she said it is as i told you they come for the ballet only but look who is that is it not the baron lappo so it is said selden and they watched him take his seat a little thinner perhaps with the passage of the months a little greyer but still erect alert i wonder what he is doing in paris shall we waylay him after the ballet yes let us there are so many things i should like to ask him i also said selden and then fell silent for the music had begun there is nothing lovelier to be seen anywhere than that chopin suite as danced at the paris opera do you regret that it is not you asked selden as the tall and willowy ida rubenstein came forward again and again to acknowledge the applause not the slightest not the smallest bit and she nestled against his shoulder i know too well what is behind the scenes besides i could never have been like that i was not a great dancer selden put his hand over hers and held it tight he could never get over his astonishment at the thought that this magnificent woman loved him was his we must hurry she added if we are going to catch the baron wait a moment here said selden and i will go around and get him i should like to surprise him i don t think he knows she nodded and he hurried away to the door by which the baron would emerge into the foyer yes there he was not changed and yet changed too in some subtle way clouded a little sad with the lines about the eyes a trifle more pronounced selden s heart moved curiously as he watched him coming forward he had never before realized how fond he had grown of the old diplomat my dear baron he said and stepped forward with hand outstretched the baron adjusted his glass and looked to see who it was why it is m selden he cried my dear friend and he caught selden s hands in both of his and shook them up and down his face irradiated how glad i am to see you again come we must have a talk yes by all means but first i want you to meet some one and he caught the baron s arm and guided him to the spot where renee waited baron he said permit me to introduce you to my wife your wife the baron s lips were trembling as he pressed them to renee s hand tiens and he dropped his glass and polished it vigorously but my dear children how happy you make me i should like to embrace you i am a silly old man yes and he touched his handkerchief to his eyes without shame but you recall so many things where shall we go we cannot talk here to rizzi s it is but a step and seizing an arm of each he led them down the great stairway and across the square talking in broken sentences all the way monsieur rizzi knew the baron lappo and he snatched the reservation card from a glass on the corner table and seated the baron and his guests there and himself took the order let me see said the baron you used to have a moet et chandon very dry ah yes the 98 said m rizzi we still have a few bottles m le baron it is foolish at my age at this hour said the baron but never mind and a little lobster yes with mayonnaise i have not forgotten your mayonnaise and afterwards what permit me said m rizzi a surprise very well agreed the baron i am sure it will be a delightful one and then as rizzi hastened away to make sure that the order was properly executed the baron turned back to his guests now let me look at you he said madame i have never seen you so lovely so radiant and you also he added to selden you also appear content content is a feeble word said selden so it is well but would you believe madame that i one day found this great imbecile in his room at monte carlo trembling with fear packing his bag even planning to run away to run away from a great happiness incredible is it not but men do stupid things like that sometimes and women too though not so often so because i had grown fond of him i ventured to give him some advice which i followed said selden you have not been sorry sorry just the same went on the baron you are not worthy of her good lord don t i know it groaned selden don t i wake up every morning in a panic for fear it is only a dream fi donc laughed renee how silly you both are the waiter had filled the glasses and the baron lifted his from the table words are so weak to express what is in the heart he said but i am sure you know what is in mine every wish for your happiness and your good fortune and may you always love each other they drank and set the glasses back upon the table and there was a little silence then m rizzi brought the lobster for the baron s approval and himself proceeded to dismember it there is something else that i recall very vividly went on the baron that day when i found you so depressed there was another thing that worried you how did you say it that your future was behind you is it still there or is it in front where it should be it is in front again said selden with a smile due also to this wonderful woman i will not have it cried renee it was m scott s idea but it was you who found a way to realize it it needed but a word she protested please tell me about it said the baron who had watched this altercation with a smile it was like this renee explained it is true that at one moment this imbecile was so stupid as to think his career ended he permitted himself to become discouraged because he could not all at once persuade his country to think as he did to make it think as he calls it internationally that is something no country does observed the baron perhaps it will come some day but i am not at all hopeful the better we know other peoples the less we seem to like them but go on it was m scott a friend who proposed the idea of an organ a journal you understand hebdomadaire where he could gather together a band of fanatics like himself and keep on fighting for his beliefs the idea appealed to him he began to think that in control of such a journal he might find life again worth living so he doubted did he that life was worth living commented the baron even when he had you it is easy to see that he is an american yes americans are like that they have something i know not what an engine a dynamo inside them driving them on i doubt if they are ever really happy as a frenchman can be happy entirely happy and content at least not for long they feel they must be doing something the baron nodded you are right what is m selden going to do he has his journal cried renee and clapped her hands yes laughed selden she got it for me much as she would buy a toy for a child to keep it quiet but how asked the baron ah it was simple renee explained the only difficulty it seemed was one of finance you remember that young m davis very well you knew by the way that he had married my niece mlle fayard but certainly laughed the baron that was another of my defeats the princess anna is still a spinster though she also has become a bride but of the church m davis is happy i trust oh yes but he also is an american though not so earnest a one as my husband here nevertheless he wished to find something to do some way to employ his money a way that would amuse him and not be too fatiguing i had only to suggest the journal it is going to be rather wonderful said selden his eyes shining i have been in new york all summer making the arrangements i was astonished at the enthusiasm i shall have a splendid staff and perhaps we shall accomplish something yet but before i started it i came back for this lady and now you are returning yes we sail to morrow on the paris that is good said the baron but come let us drink to the journal that it may accomplish all you hope for it yes he went on after a moment i am glad you are going back though that means that i shall perhaps not see you again for i am growing old but it is not well for an american to stay too long in europe it is difficult for me to explain just what i mean it is like an apple and he picked one up from the basket of fruit on the table one gathers one s crop of apples and one puts them away for the winter and some of them keep very well but others after a time begin to show little specks here and there that does not hurt them indeed it improves their flavour but they must be used at once otherwise almost before one knows it they grow rotten at the core and have to be thrown away americans are like that they do not keep well in the atmosphere of europe it is good for them yes up to a certain point they grow a little specked perhaps but their flavour is better more rich more satisfying but beyond that no forgive me he added carefully replacing the apple an old man likes to preach ah here comes the surprise m rizzi s surprise proved to be a souffle piping hot with an ice in the middle but tell us about yourself said selden what are you doing in paris it is a long story answered the baron musingly after the king s death which as you know was very sudden i felt as you had felt though with much more reason that i was finished that there was nothing left for me to do but to creep away somewhere and die then jeneski sent for me he asked me to be his minister in place of one whom he had discovered to be a traitor to him and i found that i still loved my country we get along very well together and his wife asked renee her eyes shining she has already become a sort of saint to her people they adore her and they have reason to for there is no country in europe which progresses as ours does she is very happy have you ever heard from the countess remond selden asked not directly but i believe she is in budapest plotting to place charles back on the throne it seems she has a passion for restorations that poor m halsey has been released as perhaps you know he was sent to a maison de sante for a time but jeneski refused to press the case they sat silent for a moment with full memories and tender hearts then the baron looked at his watch it is good to be here he said it renews my youth but i must go m rizzi he added to the bowing restaurateur permit me to compliment you upon this little supper i have never tasted better mayonnaise and your surprise was exquisite no i shall not need a cab i have but a step to go they passed together into the street my hotel is just there said the baron so i shall bid you good bye he looked at them for a moment pensively the french have a proverb he added to part is to die a little it is true especially for the old write me sometimes oh we shall they watched him as he walked away a gallant figure defiant of the years at the corner he turned and waved his hand then he was gone selden raised his hat i hope he said softly that some day i shall meet another man like that
