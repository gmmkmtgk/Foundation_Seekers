tonis name was antoine marcel but he was never called by it but once in his life and that was at his baptism when he was eight days old he had a shock of black hair and a snub nose and the tan and freckles on his face were an inch thick but he had a pair of black eyes so soft and bright and appealing that they might have belonged to one of the houris of paradise his wide mouth was full of sharp white teeth and when he smiled which was very often his smile began with his black eyes and ended with his white teeth at ten years of age toni was a complete man of the worldof his world that is this consisted of a gay sunny little old garrison town bienville by name in the south of france he had his friends his foes his ladylove and also he had arranged his plan of life he knew himself to be the most fortunate person in all bienville in the first place his mother madame marcel kept the only candy shop in the town and toni being the only child of his mother and she a widow enjoyed all the advantages of this envied position he had no father such as other boys hadpaul verney for example the advocates sonto make him go to school when he would rather lie on his stomach in the meadow down by the river and watch the butterflies dancing in the sun and the foolish bumblebees stumbling like drunkards among the clover blossoms paul verney was his best friendthat is except jacques toni owing to his exceptional position as the only son of the house of marcel candy manufacturer would have had no lack of friends among boys of his own age but he was afraid of other boys except paul verney this was pure cowardice on tonis part because although short for his age he was well built and had as good legs and arms and was as well able to take care of himself as any boy in bienville paul verney was a pinkcheeked clean well set up boy two years older than toni and as industrious as toni was idle as anxious to learn as toni was determined not to learn as honest with his father the lawyer as toni was unscrupulous with his mother about the amount of candy he consumed and as full of quiet courage with other boys as toni was an arrant and shameless poltroon about some things toni was classed as a bad boy and paul verney as a good boy yet the two formed one of those strange kinships of the soul which are stronger than blood ties and last as long as life itself toni being of a shrewd and discerning mind realized that paul verney would have loved him just as much if madame marcel had not kept a candy shop and this differentiated him from all the other boys in bienville and although paul often severely reprobated toni and occasionally gave him kicks and cuffs which toni could have resented but did not he had no fear whatever of paul tonis other friend jacques was a soldier jacques was about three inches high and was made of tin he had once been a very smart soldier with red trousers and an imposing shako and a musket as big as himself but the paint had been worn off the trousers and shako long ago and as for the musket only the butt remained jacques lived in tonis pocket and he was even more intimate with him than with paul verney there were seasons when paul verneys kicks and cuffs caused a temporary estrangement from him on tonis part but there was never any estrangement between toni and jacques jacques never remonstrated with toni never contradicted him never wanted any share of the candy which toni abstracted under his mothers nose and ran down in the meadow to munch there were some things toni could say to jacques that he could not say to any human being in the world not even to paul verney and jacques never showed the least surprise or disgust it is a great thing to have a perfectly complaisant unvarying friend always close to one and such was jacques to toni toni had heard something about the war which occurred a long time ago when the soldiers went a great way off from bienville to a place called russia where it was very cold in tonis mind jacques had been to that place and that was where he lost the red paint off his trousers and the black paint off his shako and the barrel of his musket toni had a way of talking to jacques and imagined that jacques talked back to him a notion which when toni repeated what jacques had said to him paul verney thought quite ridiculous jacques told toni long stories about that cold place called russia toni knew that there was another place very hot called algeria and jacques had been there too jacques had been everywhere that the soldiers had been and he told toni long tales about these places in the summer nights when toni was in his little bed under the roof with the stars peeping in roguishly at the window and madame marcels tongue and knitting needles clacking steadily down stairs at the open door of the shop and on winter days when toni left home for school and changed his mind and went snowballing instead jacques encouraged him by telling him that it was very like russia toni also found another use for jacques when he wished to say things which his mother occasionally and properly cuffed him for he could talk it all out with jacques this seemed supremely absurd to paul verney and the other boys in the neighborhood notably the five sons of clery the tailor who jeered at toni when they discovered his relations with jacques but toni was as insensible to ridicule as to reproof the only thing that really moved him was when his mother had rheumatism and her knees swelled then toni would cry as if his heart would break the big tears running down his dirty face as he sobbed and buried his fists in his hair and would not be comforted even though his mother could sit in her chair by the stove and stir the candy kettle and would give him the kettle to lick after she had poured the candy out but this was never more than once or twice a year and the rest of the time toni was as happy and as free from care as the birdlings in spring that sang under the linden trees in the park toni had already arranged a marriage of convenience for himself which was of the most advantageous description across the street from madame marcels shop was the baking establishment of mademoiselle duval and denise the niece and idol of mademoiselle duval was just two years younger than toni and as pretty as a pink and white bonbonin fact she looked not unlike a bonbon she had very pink cheeks and very blue eyes and a long plait of yellow hair like the yellow candy of  melasse  which madame marcel made every saturday morning denise was as correct as toni was incorrect she always said  oui monsieur  and  non madame  in the sweetest little voice imaginable with her eyes cast down and her plump hands crossed before her not a hair of her blond head was ever out of place and the bluechecked apron which extended from her neck to her heels was as speckless as the white muslin frock she wore in church on sundays she was the most obedient of children and madame marcel when she wept and scolded toni for his numerous misdeeds often told him that she wished he were only half as good as denise duval who had never disobeyed her aunt in her life toni smiled mysteriously whenever his mother said this and chuckled inwardly at something known only to jacques and himself namely that when he grew to be a man he meant to marry denise what could be better than the combination of a candy shop and a cook shop and bakery and then there were other advantages connected with the match many of the little girls that toni knew had large and dangerouslooking fathers some of them soldiers with fierce mustaches and these fathers sometimes kicked and cuffed idle little boys who should have been at school or at home instead of lying in the meadow or loitering upon the bench under the acacia tree by mademoiselle duvals shop inhaling the delicious odors of the bakery kitchen denise had a father who was indeed large and dangerouslooking and was a soldier too nay a sergeant and had the fiercest mustache toni had ever seen but he only came to bienville once a year for a few days on his annual leave and seemed to toni a most irrational and singular person for although he could if he wished have eaten all the cakes in his sisters shop toni never saw him so much as look at one of them on this annual reappearance of sergeant duval toni kept carefully out of the way once when he was hiding under the counter of the shop he had overheard the sergeant asking madame marcel why she did not make that little rascal of hers go to school and when madame marcel a pretty plump widow of forty tearfully admitted that she could not of herself manage toni the sergeant promptly offered to give toni a good thrashing as a favor to madame marcel this madame marcel in a panic declined and then the sergeant made a proposition still more shocking to tonis feelings then why madame he said gallantly twirling his mustache do you not marry again if i were young and handsome enough i should offer myself and then i warrant you i would make that young rogue of yours behave himself whether this were an offer or not madame marcel could not determine she might have fancied the dashing fiercelooking sergeant with his five medals on his breast but that proposition to thrash toni robbed the proposal of all its charm and besides that madame marcel although she praised denise felt a secret jealousy of the little girls perfections toni as a rule was less afraid of soldiers than any other people especially if they were cavalrymen for toni dearly loved horses and was not the least cowardly about them and felt a secret bond of sympathy between himself and all who had to do with the cult of the horse bienville had been a place of considerable military consequence in the old faroff days and still retained evidences of having had ten thousand troops quartered there in long rows of tumbledown barrack buildings but not much remained of this former consequence except the old barracks a hideous war monument in the public square and a very grim old woman the widow of a soldier in the napoleonic wars toni regarded the monument and old marie in her mob cap and spectacles sitting proud and stern on a bench in the public square as belonging to each other all the soldiers and even the officers saluted old marie as they passedtributes which were received with proud composure everything else in the town of bienville was gay and cheerful except the monument and old marie it was now garrisoned by one cavalry regiment only and was a depot for horses and cavalry recruits there was a big ridingschool with a tanbark floor where the new recruits were broken in and taught to ride it was tonis delight to crawl in by the window or the small side door and hiding under a pile of horse furniture in a corner watch the horses gallop around their hoofs beating softly on the tanbark their eyes bright and glistening their crests up and their coats shining like satin with much currying at the hands of brawny troopers toni did not know what it was to be afraid of a horse and loved nothing better than to hang about the barracks stables and ridingschool and take cheerfully the cuffs and kicks he got from the soldiers for being in the way especially was this true on sundays when he did not have paul verneys company for paul went to church obediently while toni after submitting to be washed and dressed clean was almost certain to run away disregarding his mothers frantic cries after him and spend the whole morning in the delightful precincts of the barracks stables jacques liked it too and told toni it reminded him of those glorious old days when his trousers and shako were new and he carried his musket jauntily in the long red line that set out for russia so toni haunted the barracks stables to please jacques as well as himself one glorious and nevertobeforgotten day a goodnatured trooper had hoisted toni on the back of a steadygoing old charger who knew as much about teaching recruits to ride as any soldier in the regiment the old charger being offended at finding the small wriggling object upon his back took it into his head for the first time since his colthood to plunge and kick violently and ended by bolting out of the barracks yard and making straight across the edge of the town through the meadow to the old stone bridge that spanned the river the trooper who had meant to oblige toni suddenly realized that the boy was the only son of his mother and she a widow jumping on another horse he galloped after toni down the stony street into the green lane and across the bridge the old charger who was eighteen years old gave out at the end of the bridge and came down to a sober trot he had not with all his efforts got rid of the small wriggling object on his back as for toni he had the time of his life it was the one full draft of riotous joy that he had tasted it was better even than licking the candy kettle on saturday mornings the wild flight through the air as it seemed to toni the snorting breath of the old charger the delicious sense of bumping up and down lifted him into an ecstasy when the trooper came up the horse was sedately browsing by the wayside and toni with his arms clasped around the horses neck and his black head down on his mane was in a little heaven of his own the trooper who had expected to find toni lying by the roadside mangled was immensely relieved and swore at him out of pure joy and as a reward for not having got his neck broken allowed toni to ride the old charger back into the town this was not to be compared with that wild flight through space that glorious bumping up and down that sense of delight in feeling the horse panting under him but it was something toni trotting soberly home concluded that he would not tell his mother but he meant to tell jacques all about it and putting his hand in his pocket jacques was not there oh what agony was tonis then he burst into a fit of weeping and rushing back to the ridingschool crawled around frantically everywhere the troopers would let him go searching for his loved and lost jacques the story of his ride had got out by that time and he was not kicked and cuffed when he searched with streaming eyes and loud sobs for his dearly loved jacques but jacques could not be found not even along the stone street nor by the lanes nor across the old stone bridge and the day grew dark to toni he searched all day and when he went home at night and told his mother of his loss madame marcel wept too it was no good to promise him a whole company of tin soldiers they were only tin soldiers but jacques was his friend his confidant his other self his oversoul toni cried himself to sleep that night it was so lonely up in the little garret without jacques and toni knew that jacques was lonely without him toni pictured poor jacques alone and forlorn lost in the tanbark or trampled under foot in the street or floating down the darkling river or perhaps being chewed up by the goats that browsed on the other side of the bridge in the middle of the night madame marcel was awakened by tonis groans and cries oh mama mama he cried how lonely jacques must be what is he thinking of now he has no musket to take care of himself oh mamaand then toni howled again the next day toni was up at dawn searching for his beloved he searched all the morning but he could not find the lost one when he came home to dinner at twelve oclock he met paul verney and paul saw by tonis woebegone look and tearstained face that some calamity had befallen him toni had looked forward with triumphant pleasure to telling paul about that wild ride on the old horses back but he could give it no thought paul was kind and sympathetic and understood tonis sorrow which was of some little comfort to the bereaved one while the two boys sat together on the bench under the acacia tree close to madame marcels shop up came little denise as neat and pink and white as ever one of her hands was closed and as she approached toni she said in the sweetest small voice in the world toni is this yours i found it in the streetand opening her little handoh joythere was jacques his shako a little crooked one of his legs out of plumb but it was jacques toni without a word of thanks seized jacques and rushing off flew to his favorite spot for meditationa little corner on one of the abutments of the old stone bridge once there he kissed jacques and held him to his breast and told him of the heartbreaking search made for him and jacques as usual was silently sympathetic and understood all that toni had suffered meanwhile paul verney ashamed for tonis want of manners in not thanking denise and all unaware of the great wave of gratitude that was surging through tonis whole being went into the shop and told madame marcel of tonis good fortune madame marcel was so overjoyed that she not only invited paul to help himself to whatever he wanted in the way of sweets but ran out and catching denise in her arms kissed her and brought her into the shop and invited her as she had invited paul verney to select what she wished denise with characteristic modesty took two small sticks of candy but madame marcel gave her as well as paul a large bag of very beautiful bonbons it was late in the afternoon before toni appeared his eyes shining like the stars that peeped in at his little window his wide mouth showing all his white teeth madame marcel took him by the hand and they went over with state and ceremony to thank denise for restoring the loved and lost jacques toni felt indignant that mademoiselle duval a tall thin elderly heartless maiden lady should laugh at jacques when toni displayed him and tell madame marcel she could have bought a couple of boxes of tin soldiers for onehalf the bonbons she had given denise but toni had known all the time that very few grown people know anything about boys and was simply filled with contempt for mademoiselle duval she was thin and ugly too not round and plump like his own mother and had the bad taste to prefer clean wellmannered little girls to dirty and greedy boys up to that time tonis feelings toward denise had been purely of a mercenary character but from the day she restored jacques a little seedling sentiment sprang up in tonis heart the great master of all passions had planted it there it was something like what he felt for paul verneya sense of wellbeing even of protection when denise was near she had acted the part of a guardian angel she had restored jacques to him and she did not seem to mind his dirty face and grimy hands she acquired a bewitching habit of dividing with toni the stale apple tarts her aunt gave her and beckoning to him across the street she would have him sit by her on the bench under the acacia tree and always give him at least twothirds of the tarts a few days after the tragedy of jacques loss and return sergeant duval denises father appeared for his annual visit to bienville the story of jacques was told to him and when he came over to pay his call of ceremony on madame marcel he was so rude as to twit toni about jacques toni much displeased at this retired to his usual place of refuge under the counter and concluded that when he married denise he would contrive to be absent during sergeant duvals annual visit paul verney was twelve years old and had never had any affairs of the heart like toni but one june afternoon in the same summer when toni had lost and recovered jacques and had succumbed to the tender passion fate overtook paul verney in the person of lucie bernard the prettiest little creature imaginable prettier even than denise and very unlike that small piece of perfection paul who was very fond of reading took his book which happened to be an english one to the park that afternoon of fate and was sitting on a bench laboriously puzzling over the english language when a beautiful little girl in blue with a gigantic sash and large pale blue hat with roses blushing all over it under which her dark hair fell to her waist came composedly up to him and said let me see your book paul was so astonished at being addressed by a young lady under the circumstances that he promptly handed over his book and lucie seating herself on the bench proceeded to read it paul was surprised to see that the english book through which he had been painfully spelling his way seemed perfectly easy to lucie who without a moments hesitation read on remarking casually to paul i can read english as well as i can read french my mother was an american you know and americans speak english paul did not know the piece of family history thus confided to him nor indeed did he know anything about this little nymph but he thought in his honest little heart that she was the most charming vision his boyish eyes had ever rested on he admired her dainty little slippers her silk stockings her general air of fashion but blushed at finding himself sitting on the same bench with her particularly as he saw his father the grayhaired advocate monsieur paul verney approaching he was just about to sneak away leaving his book in the hands of the fair brigand when a fiercelooking english nursery governess suddenly descended upon them and seizing lucie by the arm carried her off the governess threw pauls book down on the gravel path and paul picked it up somehow the book seemed to have a different aspect after having been held in the charming little fairys hands paul was possessed by a wholly new set of emotions he longed to tell some one of this startling adventurea little girl planting herself on the bench by him and taking his book from him without the least embarrassment or even apology what very strange little girls must those be whose mothers were american paul had plenty of friends among the boys of his own age and class and among his schoolmates but he had never confided in any of them as he did in toni marcel so presently wandering down by the bridge where he was certain to find toni at this hour of the day he saw his friend perched in the little cranny which he called his own on the bridge above the dark and rippling water two small boys could be squeezed into this place and paul verney climbing up sat side by side with toni and with his arm around his friends neck bashfully but delightedly told toni and jacques who of course heard everything that was told to toni all about this beautiful dreamlike creature he had seen in the park then toni said without any bashfulness at all i have got a sweetheart tooit is denise some day i am going to marry her and in the morning we will eat candy at mamas shop and in the afternoon we will eat cakes at mademoiselle duvals shop tonis eyes as he said this shone with a dark and lambent light paul verney on the contrary had a pair of ordinary light blue eyes through which his honest tender soul glowed he was the most romantic boy alive but all his romantic notions he had carefully concealed from every human being until then a dream had come into his boyish mind not of munching bonbons and stuffing cakes such as tonis practical mind had conceived but a dream of the beautiful lucie grown up dressed in a lovely white satin gown with a tulle veil and orange blossoms such as he had once seen a young lady wear when she was married to a dashing lieutenant in a dazzling uniform paul meant to be a dashing lieutenant in a dazzling uniform some day and then the vision of lucie stealing instantly into his mind seemed to fill a place already prepared for her there the two lads sat pauls closelycropped reddish hair resting upon tonis disheveled black shock and felt very near together indeed but how will you ever see mademoiselle again said toni to paul pauls face grew sad i dont know how i ever shall he said i never had a girl speak to me before and i never played with a girli dont think its proper and the english governess was so cross to luciefor so she called her but i shall walk every day in the park and perhaps i shall see her again paul was as good as his word and the very next afternoon walked in the park by himself he was a neat boy always but that day his face shone with scrubbing and he had on his best sailor suit of white linen and his little cane in his hand it was about four oclock in the afternoon and even the shady paths of the park glowed with a beautiful mysterious green light as paul walked along he heard a whisper in his ear it was toni who had crept up from behind a clump of shrubbery and said to him there she is just down that path sitting with captain and madame ravenel and holding madame ravenels hand paul following the path came at once on the bench where sat his divinity as toni had described he doubted if he would have had the courage to bow to her but lucie called out oh that is the nice little boy who was reading the english book yesterday paul blushing up to the roots of his reddish hair made three bows one to madame ravenel one to lucie and one to captain ravenel madame ravenel returned his bow as did the captain with much gravity and paul passed on his heart beating with rapture he had quite often seen the ravenels and knew them by name they were apparently the only sadlooking persons in all bienville they lived in a small high gloomy old house with a garden at the back just around the corner from the little street in which madame marcel had her shop captain ravenel was a retired officer but no one ever saw him talking with any of the officers of the garrison nor was he ever known either to enter any of their houses or to welcome any officers to his house madame ravenel was the most beautiful woman in bienville she was about thirty but so sadlooking that she seemed much older she always wore blacknot widows black or mourning but black gowns which although very simple had an air of elegance that set off her rare beauty wonderfully paul had seen her nearly every day since the ravenels first came to bienville three years before but he did not remember ever having seen lucie until that glorious hour when she burst on his dazzled vision and took his book away from him from the time he could first remember seeing madame ravenel he had never passed her without a feeling coming into his boyish soul like that when he saw the moon looking down on the dark water under the bridge or heard the melancholy song of the nightingale in the evening he had confided this feeling to toni who answered that both he and jacques felt the same way when they saw madame ravenel there was something sad beautiful touching and interesting about her paul could not put it into words but he felt it as did many other people madame ravenel went to church every morning and when paul was dressing himself in his little bedroom off from his fathers and mothers room he could always see her returning from church and what was most remarkable to paul captain ravenel was always either with madame ravenel or not far behind her he did not go into the church but with a book or a newspaper in his hand walked up and down outside until madame ravenel appeared when he would escort her home and so it was almost always the case when madame ravenel appeared on the street that captain ravenel was not far away it would seem as if he kept within protecting distance he was a soldierlyappearing man seriouslooking his hair and mustache slightly gray madame ravenel was always beautiful always sad always gentle and always in black paul had noticed in passing the church sometimes that madame ravenel never went beyond the entrance and never sat down even on sundays she only went a few steps inside the church door and paul asked his mother why this was madame verney shut him up shortly with that wellknown maxim that little boys should not ask questions sometime after that paul still wondering about madame ravenel asked his father why she looked so sad and why captain ravenel never stopped and laughed and talked with the officers walking the streets or dining at the cafes or strolling in the park and monsieur verney gave him the same reply as madame verney which was most discouraging this of course did not cause pauls interest in the ravenels to abate in the least it only convinced him that they had some strange and interesting story such as having found a pot of gold somewhere or having had their only child stolen from them or some of those delightfully romantic tales which a twelveyearold boy can imagine he was no less interested in lucie on finding that she belonged in some way to madame ravenel he had walked on a considerable distance in the park and was trying to screw up his courage to turn around and walk back past the bench where lucie sat when he suddenly found her at his side her dark eyes glowed brightly and she was tiptoeing in her delight i know all about you she said triumphantly you are paul verney the advocates son i like little boys very muchvery muchbut i never have a chance to see anything of them however just now i began to chase a butterfly and my sister sophie did not call me back but you are the butterflyand at this she burst into a ripple of impish laughter paul was so surprised that he did not have time to be shocked at the boldness on the part of this young lady of ten years but his heart began to thump violently and he was trembling when he said to her but arent you afraid to leave your sister not in the least replied lucie airily i am half american and american children are not afraid of anything so harper my nursery governess says what can happen to me and besides that i have always had my own waythat is almost alwaysi had it about coming to see my sister sophie would you like me to tell you about it paul was only too charmed to hear anything lucie might tell him although in a panic for fear the fiercelooking english nursery governess might appear lucie without further ado seated herself with him on the ground and sticking her little slippered feet out on the grass began with the air of scheherazade when with confidence she turned her matchless power on the bridegroom who meant to murder her next morning sophie you know is my sister although she is much older than i am we had the same papa but not the same mama but sophie was just like a mama to me after my own mama died she was married then to another man named count delorme how i hated him he was so crosscross to me and cross to sophie and cross to everybody he had a son too when sophie married him and that boyedouard was his namewas horrid just like count delorme i lived with sophie then and once a year i would go and visit my grandmother bernard she is very tall and handsome and always wears black velvet or black satin and looks very fierce everybody is afraid of her except me but she isnt really in the least fierce and i have my own way with her much more than i have with sophie all that grandmama can do is to scold and say oh you little american what am i to do with you you need more strictness than any french child i ever knew and then she lets me do as i please lucie stopped here and cast a side glance at paul she possessed the art of the storyteller and wanted to know whether paul was interested in what she was telling him paul was so much interested in lucie that he would have listened with pleasure to anything she said but the beginning of what she was telling him sounded like a book and he listened with eagerness lucie seeing this proceeded like many other people she enjoyed being the heroine of her own tale and it lost nothing in the telling well i used to like this visit to my grandmothershe has a big chateau larger than the commandants house five times as largebigger than the hotel de ville lucie opened her arms and hands wide to show paul the enormous size of the chateau bernard and then she has such beautiful thingsso many servants carriages horses chandeliers and gardensthe most beautiful gardens and a park ten times as large as this paul listened to this somewhat coldly he did not like bragging and could not understand the innocent imaginative delight which lucie took in describing a pretty chateau i used to love to go there and visit grandmama when i lived with sophie we lived in another placea great big city called chalons but i loved being with sophie best she was not at all like what she is now but she was the gayest person in chalons she wore beautiful pink gowns and white hats and feathers and went to balls every night but she always had time to look after me she used to take me in the carriage with her every afternoon to drive and before she went to a ball she always saw me undressed and in my bed and came to tell me good night and she looked over my lessons and made me practise my music and did everything for me just as the other little girls mamas did for them then something happenedi dont know what it wasit was something dreadful though and i remember the day it rained very hard and captain ravenel came in the afternoon and was sitting in the drawingroom with sophie and count delorme came in and there was a terrible noise and the door came open and count delorme struck sophie with his fist hard and captain ravenel caught her in his arms i was leaning over the baluster and then harper ran down and carried me off and would not let me go near sophie though i heard her crying outside the door and i cried inside the door just as hard as i could the next day harperthat is my nursery governess that takes care of me now and dragged me away yesterdaycame and took me in a carriage to the railway station without letting me say goodby to sophie and carried me off to my grandmamas chateau paul was interested enough now lucies story sounded more and more like a story out of a book when i came to the chateau my grandmothershe is sophies grandmama just as much as she is minekissed me and hugged me and told me i was to live there but i was very angry because i hadnt seen sophie to say goodby even and i kept asking why sophie didnt come to see me or send for me or even write me a letter i used to write her letters myselfyou see i am ten years old and i can write very welland i gave them to grandmama to send to sophie but i found a whole bunch of my letters halfburned in the grate in grandmamas room then i saw they were deceiving me so i wrote a letter and i stole a postage stamp and i knew how to address it to sophie but i got no reply then i stole some more postage stamps and wrote some more letters but i never heard anything about sophie i had a governess and musicmaster but grandmama never made me study or practise my music as sophie had done she let me do everything i wanted except to see or hear from sophie no matter what i asked for grandmama first refused and then she got it for me she bought me the finest doll in paris and a little pony and wicker phaeton and used to take me to the circusmy grandmama lives near paris you knowand gave me five francs of my own to spend every saturday but i wanted sophie at night i would think about her and cry and cry and then grandmama would have me put in her bed and she would cry too but she would not let me see sophie at last i couldnt eat anythingnot even bonbonsand they sent for the doctor who said grandmama must take me to the seashore but after we came from the seashore i missed sophie more and more and i cried every night and would not eat and at last i told grandmama if she did not let me see sophie i would starve myself to deathi would never eat anythingi would hold my breath until i diedor eat a cake of paint out of my paintbox paint is poisonous you know grandmama told me of a little girl who died from eating paint out of her paintbox at last even the doctor grew frightened and told grandmama if i did not see my sister sophie he was afraid i would be very ill so thenthis was two summers agoshe let harper bring me here and i stayed a whole week with sophie captain ravenel is her husband now and not that hateful count delorme and i didnt know captain ravenel before but i love him now almost as much as i do sophie he is so kind and good and not a bit cross sophie told me that i must be satisfied with my week with her and must be good and perhaps grandmama would let me come again and that when i went back to the chateau bernard i must eat and keep well and not cry any more i did as sophie told me but sophie doesnt know grandmama as well as i do i begged her all last winter to let me come and see sophie again and all this spring and then this summer but she wouldnt let me and then i found out how to manage grandmama paul listened to this with an interest which bordered however on disapproval he had never heard of small children managing their elders but lucie had told him that she was half american which might account for anything paul had heard that the americans were a wild people so perhaps even the children did as they pleased lucie drew up her little silkstockinged foot and settled her skirts around her and how do you suppose i did it i didnt eat anything for two days grandmama was frightened to death when i wouldnt eat they left cakes around and beautiful little biscuit but i knew what that was for and wouldnt touch them so after three days grandmama gave in and told me that harper might bring me to see sophie and so i came and i am to stay two whole weeks and after this every time i wish to see sophie all i will have to do is to stop eating for that frightens grandmama and she lets me have my own way paul eyed the bewitching lucie still with some disapproval but do you think it is right to treat your grandmama so isnt she a good grandmama to you oh yes indeed answered lucie i love her very much but not like sophie you love your aunts and grandmama but not like your mother that was quite true for paul was as fond in his quiet way of his mother and father as lucie in her violent and demonstrative fashion was of sophie or as toni was curiously fond of madame marcel while this conversation was going on toni who had seen lucie go chasing after the butterfly watched captain and madame ravenel paul had told him there was something mysterious about the pair and toni was vaguely conscious of this strangeness and felt in his childish ignorant way like paul the charm of madame ravenels touching beauty he heard madame ravenel say what can have become of the child and captain ravenel got up at once to look for her going a little way along the path down which lucie had disappeared and then a strange thing happened before tonis eyes a young officer coming by with a waxed mustache and his cap set jauntily on the side of his head stopped directly in front of madame ravenel and looked at her with a smile which toni did not at all understand but which made madame ravenels pale face flush to the roots of her dark hair then the officer said in an insolent yet insinuating voice may i be permitted madame to admire your beauty a little closerand sat down on the bench without any invitation throwing his arm around the back of it so as almost to embrace madame ravenel who started up with a cry at that moment captain ravenel appeared at the back of the bench he was not so big a man as the young officer but catching him by his collar he threw him sprawling on the ground and then deliberately stamped upon him as he lay prostrate madame ravenel stood as still as a statue the officer sprang from the ground and would have flown at captain ravenels throat but two other officers passing ran toward them and separated them and pinioned the arms of the officer to his side toni heard captain ravenel say as he handed his card to one of the officers i saw this man grossly insult this lady and he shall pay for it with his lifeand then madame ravenel swayed a minute or two and fell over in a dead faint the two officers hurried their comrade off leaving captain ravenel alone with madame ravenel who lay prone on the grass quite insensible toni remembered having once seen a lady faint in the park and that some one fetched water from the fountain close by and dashed it on her face but he had nothing to fetch it in having no hat on his heada hat being a useless incumbrance which he only wore on those rare sundays when his mother dragged him to church against his earnest protests but there was paul verneys hat toni scampered down the path and in two minutes had found paul lucie was just leaving him and toni mysteriously beckoning to him whispered fill your cap with water and take it to madame ravenel she is lying on the grass fainting like i saw a lady once and somebody at that time threw water on the lady paul with the true lovers instinct to serve those loved by his adored one ran to the fountain and filled his cap with water and then flew as fast as his legs would carry him to the place where madame ravenel still lay most of the water was spilled over his white linen suit but there was enough left to revive madame ravenel thank you my boy said captain ravenel as he dashed the water on madame ravenels face then she opened her eyes and tried to stand up paul ran for more water and came back with about a tablespoonful left in his cap while he himself was dripping like a water spaniel but madame ravenel by that time was sitting up on the bench pale with her dark hair disheveled and her hat still lying on the ground captain ravenel was supporting her paul verney being a gentleman at twelve years of age felt instinctively that having done a service it was his place to retire he received a tremulous thank you from madame ravenel who then asked anxiously of captain ravenel where is luciewhat has become of the child but lucie at that moment appeared and paul longing to remain and hear more interesting stories about grown people from lucies cherry lips still felt bound to retire which he did toni on the contrary making no pretensions to being a gentleman had to see the whole thing played through he concealed himself behind the shrubbery and saw with pain but with deep interest madame ravenel weep a littletears which captain ravenel tried to check then in a moment harper appeared and lucie went off her usually sparkling dimpling little face quite sorrowful and then madame ravenel leaning on captain ravenels arm walked away toni stood and pondered these things to himself what queer creatures grown people were after all still they were very interesting if one got rid of all their scrapes and muddles what did that dashinglooking officer want to put his arm around madame ravenel for toni reflecting on these things took jacques out and asked him about them but jacques replied that he knew no more about them than toni did that night toni not being made to go to bed at eight oclock like paul verney and all other wellconducted boys was prowling around the garden of the commandants house of which the back was toward the little street in which madame marcel lived the garden gate was open and toni sneaked in and seated himself on the grass just outside the window on the ground floor which looked into a room that was colonel duquesnes study toni had an object in this there was a great clump of gooseberry bushes under this window and toni loved to gorge himself on colonel duquesnes gooseberries true he could have had all the gooseberries he wished from his mother but they did not have the delicious flavor of those surreptitiously confiscated from colonel duquesnes garden toni was afraid of the commandant as he was afraid of the monument in the public square and of old marie and of everybody in fact except his mother and paul verney and little denise and jacques but he knew the garden much better than the commandant did and his short legs were quick enough to save him in case any one should come out of the house toni saw through the window the two officers who had separated the other officer and captain ravenel sitting in grave conversation with the colonel it is most unfortunate said the colonel a gravelooking graymustached man what could have induced ravenel to come to bienville to live it would seem to be the last place on earth that he and madame ravenel would select then one of the other officers said to the colonel i understand that they came here principally on account of madame ravenels health and besides ravenel owns the house in which they live it isnt much of a house but i hear that delorme spent every franc of madame ravenels money and they have nothing but this house and ravenels halfpay to live on which probably accounts for their being in bienville but i must say that they have kept themselves as much out of sight as possible i knew delorme said the colonel and a more unprincipled scoundrel never lived it is a great pity that ravenel didnt knock the fellows brains out on the day when madame delorme left delorme nobody would have been sorry for it i have known both ravenel and madame ravenel for years and they are the last people living that i should expect to commit the folly they did going off together and remaining two or three weeks before they separated it was a species of madness but they have paid dearly for it i understand that madame ravenel is tormented by religious scruples about her divorce the colonel got up from his chair and walked up and down two or three times the vision of sophie ravenel in her triumphant beauty ten years before and the pale consciencestricken sophie of today overwhelmed him he remembered ravenel spirited gay and caring for no other than a soldiers life and now cut off from all comrades his lifework ended surely these two had paid the full price for their three weeks desperate folly of love shame rapture and despair then awakening suddenly to the madness of what they had done they had separated not to see each other again until delorme had obtained a divorce and sophie after having been branded as a wife who had dishonored her husband was married to ravenel who for her sake had sacrificed all his worldly prospects the colonel was a strict moralist but in his heart he reckoned that there were many worse people in the world than sophie and ravenel the two officers sat silent while the colonel took a couple of turns about the room and then he sat down and spoke again but the question iswhat are we to do about creci creci swears said the older of the two officers that madame ravenel smiled at him as he passed and gave him an invitation to come and sit by her i am afraid said the colonel in a very cold voice as he shook the ash from his cigar that creci is mistaken mistaken thought toni to himself creci was lying pure and simple that toni knew for he had seen the whole transaction we are bound under the circumstances said captain merrilat to take lieutenant crecis word for it naturally madame ravenels word can not be taken colonel duquesne pondered for a while stroking his mustache and then said come to me in two daysi will see what can be doneand then after a little more talk the two officers got up and went away and colonel duquesne strolled out in the garden where toni was still behind the gooseberry bushes the colonel knew the widow marcels boy and disapproved of him on general principles but did not suspect the little scamp was hidden behind the gooseberry bushes which the colonel passed as he walked up and down the dark path as he turned to pass the third time he heard toms shrill boyish voice piping out you know jacques i saw it alli was watching captain and madame ravenel and i saw captain ravenel when he got up and went awayand then the young officer came along and madame ravenel wasnt looking his way at allshe was looking down with her hands in her lap and i dont think she even saw the lieutenant until he came up to her quite close and said something impudent to her and then madame ravenels face got as red as red could be and the lieutenant plumped himself down as close to her as he could and threw his arm around the back of the bench and madame ravenel looked scared to death and jumped up and then captain ravenel came and caught the lieutenant by the collar and threw him on the ground and wiped his foot on him and you know jacques you saw that just as i did the colonel stopped suddenly in his walk and looking about saw tonis little black head among the gooseberry bushes he did not see the other boy with whom toni was talking but he understood well enough what toni meant then toni kept on jacques i tell you madame ravenel wasnt even looking at the lieutenant and i know she hates him by the way she pushed him off when he sat down by her the colonel walked around the gooseberry bushes and there sat toni on the ground but jacques whom the colonel innocently supposed to be another boy was not in sight being then in tonis pocket so my lad said the colonel you saw the fight between captain ravenel and lieutenant creci but toni looking up at the colonels short soldierly figure and determined air was seized with one of those sudden panics which often overcame him he could not have said a word to save his life with the colonels keen eyes fixed on him so jumping up and seizing hold of jacques in his pocket toni ran as fast as his legs would take him to the garden gate through the narrow street and up into his own little attic room and did not feel safe until he was tucked in his own bed with jacques under the pillow to keep him company it was the habit of the colonel to take a walk in the park very early every morning directly after his breakfast coffee and it was also captain ravenels practice to pass through the park at the same hour his however was not a pleasure stroll but was for the purpose of taking to the postoffice some hundreds of envelopes which he addressed every day for a pittance with which to eke out his halfpay the two men had been friends in past days although the colonel was much older and higher in rank than ravenel but they passed each other morning after morning without a word being exchanged ravenel gravely saluting the colonel and the colonel slightly returning the bow and each man felt a tug at his heart for the other man colonel duquesne was a great stickler for the moralities and ravenels fall had been to him a terrible shock he understood what little lucie and paul verney and toni did not understand in the least the particular thing which had befallen madame ravenel it was the old sad story of a villainous husband to a sensitive and dependent woman of a man a thousand times better than the husband loving the wife silently of hearing her unjustly accused in his presence and even suffering the indignity of a blow that blow drove sophie delorme into ravenels arms it seemed to her in the horror and shock of the moment as if there were no other place for her she could not go to her grandmother madame bernard who had arranged the match between sophie and delorme and who had shut her eyes stubbornly to the wretchedness of the marriage apart from madame bernard sophie was singularly alone in the world her small fortune had been squandered by delorme she loved ravenel because she could not help it and so these two poor souls like goodly ships driven against each other by storms and hurricanes to their destruction this man and this woman were driven together driven to transgress the moral law driven by the iron hand of fate into a position the last on earth that would have been expected of them the victory of passion and despair over honor had been brief in three weeks they recoiled from what they had done delorme had promptly begun proceedings for a divorce and ravenel had besought sophie to repair their fault as far as possible in the eyes of the world by marrying him as soon as the decree of divorce should be granted but sophie was a deeply religious woman and it seemed to her an increase of wrongdoing to marry ravenel there was but one way out of it and ravenel by employing one of the best ecclesiastical lawyers in france discovered that there were certain technicalities in the religious marriage that delorme had not complied with and it was possible to have the marriage religious as well as civil annulled only then did sophie consent to marry him for her he had sacrificed his position in the army his standing in the world and his modest fortune and had done it as if it were a privilege instead of a sacrifice no woman of sophie ravenels lofty ideals could fail to appreciate this but neither could she forget that she had fallen from her high estate however she might strive to be happy ravenel could not but see that she would live and die a consciencestricken woman she made no moan however but secretly took on herself the whole sin ravenel did the same taking on himself all the blame and so their married life although sad and colorless was one of exquisite harmony they led a most retired life rarely leaving their house except for sophies early visit to the church and the walk in the park in the afternoons whenever she appeared on the street as paul often had noticed ravenel was never far away and sophie had any affront been offered her had his protection close at hand to them one place was the same as another and as colonel duquesne had imagined necessity had much to do with their settling in bienville an officer on halfpay has not much choice of residence and the little old house in bienville at least gave them a shelter so they had come bringing their remorse with them likewise their love the wages of sin in their case was not luxury they lived as poorly as gentle people could live and exist they kept no servant and as it was painful for them to have to dine at the cafes sophie with the assistance of one old woman who was still active at seventyfive prepared all their meals with her own hands she made those cheap and simple black gowns whose fit and style were the despair and admiration of the professional dressmakers in bienville in this matter of her dress and appearance sophie retained all the pride which had ever been hers when she was as little lucie said the gayest and bestdressed woman in chalons it was a part of a duty that she owed ravenel for with the fine generosity of a woman she reckoned herself much in ravenels debt and felt she should lose as few as possible of those charms that had won him to his downfall she never lost her appearance of elegance by dint of an ingenuity little short of miraculous she uttered no complaining word and no day passed over her head that she did not tell ravenel he was the best man in the world there was a wheezy old piano in the little house and on this she played to him the airs that had charmed him in the days at chalons she was externally the most modest and reserved woman in bienvilleand who shall say that she was not the same in her soul be not too free you virtuous people to condemn this poor lady there are sinners and sinners if you please as for captain ravenel his wrongdoing had placed on him according to his way of thinking an obligation of a life most spotless he had always been as colonel duquesne had said a man of high character but when love and misery and fate had made him in a way the destroyer of the woman he loved and respected most on earth it raised him to a pitch of heroic virtue like sophie no drudgery was too great for him and when she was preparing their modest dinner captain ravenel was digging in the garden by the labor of his own hands he raised the most beautiful pease potatoes and melons that had ever been seen he would have worked every hour of the day except that he felt as sophie did with regard to him that he must not lose all of those graces and habits of a gentleman which had first made her love him in the afternoon he dressed himself in his wellbrushed frock coat and together he and sophie took a walk and sat and listened to the band playing in the park this was their chief recreation at night he sat up many hours addressing those envelopes and circulars which he took to the postoffice early in the morning and for which he was paid a pittance like sophie no complaint escaped him and for every protestation of love and gratitude she made to him he returned in twofold they were not happylife had no happiness to give two souls like theirs situated as they werebut they would have died if they had been torn apart illustration not daring so much as to lift her eyes to the altar it was a portion of sophies selfimposed punishment that she should never go fully into a church halting as paul verney had noticed just within the door and like the publican not daring so much as to lift her eyes to the altar but calling herself a sinner and feeling herself to be the greatest sinner on earth another part of her punishment was the separation from lucie the little halfsister whom she had attended from the hour of her birth with a mothers care and toward whom she had taken a mothers place but she made no complaint of this nor of anything else and when lucie by her own ingenuity had contrived to come back to her it brought a gleam of joy into sophies life such as she had never expected to feel again madame bernard remained unforgiving as lucie had truly said although as stern and uncompromising in looks as the monument in the public square at bienville and old marie who sat on the bench and knitted sternly madame bernard was at heart a greater coward about people than little toni she knew if she once saw sophie everything would be forgiven and so she avoided seeing her and dared not even write to her little lucie had had no real difficulty in accomplishing her object of seeing sophie by the means she had retailed to paul and otherwise wrapped the stately madame bernard around her little finger lucie who was accustomed to luxury adapted herself with ingenuous perversity to the plain way of living of the ravenels she even learned to make omelettes herself and with her little lacetrimmed gown tucked up around her waist to the horror of harper the nursery governess actually learned to broil a chop as well as sophie could lucie was a child of many passions her attachment to sophie was one of the strongest and sophie alone of everybody on earth could bend lucie to her willthat is as long as they were together for childlike lucie forgot all the gentle commands and recommendations laid upon her by sophie when they separated and remembered few of the admirable things which sophie asked her to do but she loved sophie with a determined constancy that none of madame bernards blandishments nor all the bonbons in paris could change at the hour when colonel duquesne and the two officers were discussing crecis insult to sophiefor insult they all well knew it to besophie and ravenel were sitting on their balcony after their supper and lucie had been put to bed sophie had not spoken to ravenel of what had happened in the park since their agitated walk home but now she said timidly placing her hand in his in the soft purple twilight which enveloped them and through which the lights of the town twinkled beneath them what do you think that man creci will do prefer charges against me i suppose returned ravenel but if he does i think he will get the worst of it no one could believe that you sophie could give any encouragement to a man like that your life here has been too prudent no other woman i believe could have lived with the beauty and natural gaiety that you possess effacing herself so completely and all for me what an evil hour for you dearest that ever we met do not say that cried sophie if i had it all to live over again i would do as i have done exceptexcept she buried her face in her hands ravenel too looked ashamed to both of them the iron entered into their souls at the recollection of the first three weeks after sophie left her husband then sophie raising her head presently said but it was an evil hour for you i might have endured my fate while but for me you would have married happily and be today where you ought to bein a good position with your talents recognized and the two poor souls often talked together in this way speaking frankly to each other and each taking the blame they spoke a while longer each fearing and dreading the morrow and then sophie went to see that lucie was asleep in her little bed while ravenel went to his work of addressing envelopes lucie was not asleep as she should have been but wideawake and very talkative oh sophie she said when sophie sat down by the bed in lucies little room how glad i am that you are married to captain ravenel i like him so much better than count delorme sophie i hated count delorme so did i replied sophie her pale face flushing and her tongue for once committing an indiscretion but the child was quite unconscious of it she hated count delorme herself and saw every reason why sophie and every one else should hate him and edouard continued lucie that hateful hateful boy oh i think it is ever so much nicer as it is and if only i could live with you and make omelettes every day and have a little garden and dig in it when captain ravenel is digging in the big garden how much i should like it and then i could go and visit grandmama at the chateau sophie laid her head down on the pillow by lucie and kissed the childs soft red lips after all how happy she could be but for that terrible moral law which because they had transgressed it kept thundering in her ears its maledictions but no shame and no sorrow can wholly take away the joy of loving and being loved as sophie loved and was loved next morning about seven oclock as ravenel was walking through the park to the postoffice with his parcel of circulars he came face to face with colonel duquesne the colonel instead of passing him with a stiff nod halted before him and said good morning captain ravenel ravenel was startled but he replied saluting respectfully good morning sir there is i am afraid some trouble ahead of you with regard to lieutenant creci said the colonel speaking very deliberately i wish to say now from long knowledge of the lady in the case that i can not believe she committed the smallest impropriety nor do i think that crecis word that she did so would carry the slightest conviction to any person in bienville and whatever comes of it the ladys name must be kept out of the affair absolutely ravenel could have fallen upon his knees with gratitude when colonel duquesne said this the idea that sophies name should be dragged into a public scandal was heartbreaking to him the tears came into his eyes and he was about to extend his hand impulsively to colonel duquesne but changed his mind and crossed his arms he bowed however profoundly and said i can not express to you sir how much i thank you for what you have said it is welldeserved by that lady who is the most modest the most retiring the purestminded ravenel stopped with a lump in his throat the tears by that time had dropped upon his dark sunburned face he brushed them away but colonel duquesne thought no less of him for those tears i am quite of your mind he said quietly concerning that lady the circumstances are most unfortunate i can express to you privately a degree of sympathy which i can not do publicly but believe me no man could be more anxious than i am to save that ladys feelings in this affair captain merrilat will wait on you this morning i think if you will agree to make him a very slight apology everything can be arranged and for my part i pledge you my word as lieutenant crecis commanding officer to use all the power i possess to induce him to accept anything in the shape of an apology which you may offer but i can not apologize blurted out poor ravenel the lady in question was sitting quietly on the bench and did not even see creci and he came up and spoke to her insultingly and the lady became embarrassed and alarmed and then he sat down by her most impudently and improperly and attempted to throw his arm around her and then i caught him and thrashed himand am i to apologize for that the colonel paused the story which he had overheard that naughty little boy of madame marcels telling the night before in the garden corresponded exactly with what ravenel had saidnot that ravenels word alone needed any corroboration with colonel duquesne yes he said you must say something which may be construed into an apology not a man in the regiment sustains crecis course but for reasons which you understand the chief of which is the lady in the case it must be hushed up i have arranged for you to meet creci this morning at my house and the affair shall be settled before me ravenel with his soul in his eyes looked at the colonel who was a man with a heart in his breast even though he was a colonel and then the colonel held out his hand ravenel gripped it for a moment and then hurried away through the park that he might not miss the morning mail for he was as careful and prompt in the performance of his duty with regard to these circulars which he addressed at next to nothing a thousand as if it had been the bestpaid and most important work in the world but his heart was more joyful than it had been for many a day he had something pleasant to take back to sophie when he returned and they had their eleven oclock breakfast together in the little garden he looked so cheerful that sophie felt almost gay they sat with lucie at the little round table with a white cloth on it under a big acacia tree close by them were a dozen tall oleanders in tubs for captain ravenel turning his unusual skill in flowers to account supplied most of the cafes in town with their ornamental plants their breakfast was simple but very good and lucie triumphed in the production of the omelette which was the work of her own hands she was already lamenting that in one week more she would have to go back to the chateau bernard and madame bernards chef oh it is so nice to be with you here she cried and then said as she had done two or three times before it is so much nicer than at chalonsand i hated count delorme as she spoke the name ravenel looked away while poor sophie blushed and trembled but lucie meaning to please her hosts kept on when i am grown up and get my money i intend to come and live with you sophie and captain ravenel harper says that when i am eighteen i shall have a whole lot of money in america that grandmama can not keep me out of and that i can spend it as i like and i will come and live in bienville and have a carriage and everything i want but i think i would like to stay in this houseit is small but so very pleasant harper should not tell you such things lucie said sophie she looked at captain ravenel it is impossible to keep nursery governesses and upper servants from gossipinghow much had she told lucie in the past and how much might she tell her in the future presently lucie was sent away to practise on the piano for it was a part of sophies plan that when lucie returned to her grandmother after these brief and forced visits the child should show some improvement then ravenel told sophie that as soon as he finished breakfast he was to go to colonel duquesnes house and have the meeting with creci and he repeated the colonels chivalrous words to her sophies pale face flamed up it was something in the arid waste of life to have known two such men as the one before her and colonel duquesne who would not strike a woman when she was helpless before him and who pitied the weaknesses of the human heart but when it comes to apologizing said ravenel grinding his teeth what am i to sayto say that i am sorry for having kicked him when i wished to kill him dearest replied sophie do what the colonel advises he would not counsel you to do anything against your honor at twelve oclock precisely ravenel presented himself at the colonels house he was in his uniform for although retired he was still an officer the soldiers saluted him respectfully and the aides spoke to him politely everybody felt sorry for ravenel and most honest and brave men in his place would have done as he had he was ushered into the colonels room and there sat colonel duquesne and creci with his two friends the officers who had dragged ravenel and himself apart in the park the colonel and others present bowed gravely to ravenel who returned the bow and seated himself at the colonels invitation and then after a little silence the colonel stated the case briefly but said at the end with emphasis i think in every case of this sort without impugning lieutenant crecis word the presumption is that a mistake has been made whatever lieutenant creci thought about the lady in question whose name must by no means be mentioned i feel sure that she was unconscious of any attempt to attract his attention we will proceed upon that supposition if you please crecis handsome stupid face grew scarlet ravenels dark skin turned a shade darker the other two officers looked impassive then the colonel went on to say that he would recommend captain ravenel to make an apology to lieutenant creci and he would strongly urge lieutenant creci to accept it at that there was a long silence ravenel really knew not how to apologize for having done what his honor and his conscience and his inclination had told him was right to do he blamed himself for not having stamped his foot in crecis face and so marked him for life the pause became awkward while ravenel was turning these things over in his mind at last with the colonels eye fixed upon him commandingly he mumbled something about regretting that the occasion had arisenthe rest of it was lost in his mustache for the colonel as soon as he heard the word regret turned promptly to creci there was a menace in colonel duquesnes eyea look which commanded obedience creci inwardly raging sullenly bowed and captain merrilat said quickly i think lieutenant creci accepts the apology and we may consider the affair as ended everybody present knew what colonel duquesne meant he had known sophie when she was fresh from her convent school had known her as the young wife of an unfeeling and vicious manhe had known her at the moment when her courage failed her and she had left the hard and stony path she had been traveling with delorme to go on a path still hard and stony with ravenel colonel duquesne was tenderhearted where women were concerned and felt in his soul that he could not have stood delorme as long as sophie had stood him all these things were working in his mind when ravenel and creci and the two officers were rising and making their formal adieus ravenel went home to sophie and the two were almost gay over the result of the affair which had been so baneful to them in the beginning it almost seemed to the two poor souls as if they had some friends left that very afternoon when taking their one solitary indulgencetheir walk in the parkthey passed the colonel who bowed to sophie quite in the old way although he did not speak the colonel was a widower with no daughters and therefore was quite safe in doing this not having a domestic court of inquiry ahead of him lucie had only four days more to remain in bienville but except for the approaching parting from sophie and ravenel they were indeed very happy days to her the childs active and aggressive little mind which was part of her american inheritance dwelt on that charming vision which harper with the usual indiscretion of servants and nursery governesses had shown herthat vision of all the money she wished to spend which would be hers at eighteen with no one not even madame bernard to interfere lucie enjoyed another stolen interview with paul verney for this young lady at ten years of age was a welldeveloped flirt and romanticist not all her french training had been able to get the american out of her and she had with it all the generous impulses and the happy daring with which the american child seems to be dowered paul verney in his afternoon walks had the pleasure of bowing twice to captain and madame ravenel but neither time was lucie with them on the afternoon before lucie left bienville she was walking with the ravenels harper as usual in the distance lucie with the ingenuity peculiar to her age and sex determined to go on a search for paul verney and so arranged her plans with much art she asked sophie if harper could take her to the fountain in the park to see the little fishes swim in the basin this reasonable proposal being agreed to harper took lucie by the hand and off they went once at the fountain around which there were benches harper was sure to find some of her colleagues and lucie providing she reported at the end of every ten minutes was certain of an hour of liberty lucie utilized her first ten minutes by finding paul verney there he was sitting on the same bench and reading the same english book as on the first afternoon that she had spoken to him when paul saw his ladylove approach he rose and blushed and smiled and lucie bowed and smiled without blushing however seating herself on the bench and settling her fluffy white skirts around her she said to paul with a queenly air you may sit down then she added quite seriously i am going away tomorrow pauls boyish heart gave a jump he was secretly very much afraid of lucie and disapproved of herbut she was so fascinating and life at bienville would seem so different after she went away he stammered i am sorry mademoiselle but i shall come back said lucie in a sprightly tone you see it is so very easy to frighten grandmama all i have to do is to stop eating for two days and it really isnt so bad at all paul verney although not a greedy youngster like toni thought that to go without eating for two days was a very severe test of affection but it was like everything else about lucie dashing and daring and quite out of the common he replied timidly i hope mademoiselle you wont make yourself ill it always makes me ill to go without my dinner even i suppose said lucie that is when your mama punishes youisnt it paul blushed more deeply than ever he wished to appear a man and here was lucie reminding him that he was after all only a little boy then lucie asked him what do you mean to be when you grow up a soldier mademoiselle said paul straightening himself up involuntarily i am going to the cavalry school at st cyr i shall ride a fine horse like the officers here in bienville i told papa and mama my last birthday and they are quite willing but it will be a long time yet said lucie wont it not so very long said paul in four years i shall go to the cavalry school and then in four years more i shall be graduated and then i shall be a lieutenant and have a sword and wear a helmet with a horsehair plume in it the picture which paul unconsciously drew of himself was very attractive to the imaginative lucie she looked at him meditatively and wondered how he would look when he was grown up with his sword and horsehair plume paul was not particularly handsome but his somewhat stocky figure was wellknit and he looked unqualifiedly clean and honesttwo great recommendations in any man or boy by the time you are a lieutenant with a sword she continued i shall be a young lady with a long train and i shall be very rich harper told me so and then i am coming to bienville and i will buy the commandants house and have the finest carriage in bienville and have a ball every night paul listened to this with a sudden sinking of the heart the realization came to him as much as if he had been twenty instead of twelve years old that this splendid picture which lucie drew of her future did not accord with his the son of a bienville advocate who lived in a modest house and whose mother made most of her own gowns and besides that he did not like and did not understand lucies innocent bragging he was a sweet sensible boy with a practical french mind who never bragged about anything in his life and who did heroic boyish things in the most matteroffact manner in the world and never thought they were heroic but lucie was so charming like many a grown up man his judgment and his heart went different ways lucie had his heartthere was no question about it lucie would have liked to stay a long time with paul and paul would have enjoyed staying with lucie but looking up he saw his father and mother approaching on their way to the terrace where like all the other inhabitants of bienville they spent their summer afternoons having ices or drinking tea and listening to the music the verneys were a comfortablelooking couple fond of each other and adoring paul they smiled when they saw paul seated on the bench and the charming little girl talking to him they knew it was none of pauls doing for he was afraid of girls and always ran away from them as his father and mother drew nearer pauls impulse to rush away in order to avoid being seen with lucie almost overpowered him but he was at heart a courageous boy and a chivalrous one and he thought it would be cowardly to run off so he stood or rather sat his ground with apparent boldness but his face was reddening and his heart thumping as his father and mother approached lucie however was not at all timid and when she saw monsieur and madame verney coming so close asked paul who they were it is my father and mother said paul in a shaky voice opening his book with much embarrassment and turning over its pages i think they look very nice said lucie and see they are smiling at you i think they are smiling at you because you are talking to me pauls head went down still lower on his book and his face burned crimson lucie with great selfpossession got up from the bench and making a pretty little bow to monsieur and madame verney skipped off back to harper monsieur verney a pleasantfaced man of fifty prodded paul with his cane what charming young lady was that my son with whom you were speaking mademoiselle lucie bernard paul managed to articulate and a very pretty little thing she is said madame verney who was herself pretty and pleasantlooking sitting down on the bench and putting pauls blushing face upon her shoulder for shame charles to tease the boy so paul hid his face on his mothers shoulder meanwhile screwing up his courage to its ultimate point then raising his head and looking his father directly in the eye paul said when i grow up i mean to marry mademoiselle lucie the boys clear blue eyes looked directly into his fathers which were also clear and blue and between the boy and the man a look of sympathy of understanding passed his father might laugh at him but paul knew that it was only a joke after all and as long as he behaved himself no unkind word would be spoken to him by that excellent father oho said monsieur verney to madame verney so we are promised a daughterinlaw already that pleases me very much said madame verney smiling i hope that mademoiselle lucie will grow up as good as she is pretty and then i shall be very glad to have her for a daughterinlaw then his mother kissed him and paul got up and walked on with his father and mother holding a hand of each and wondering if any boy ever had such a kind father and mother they joked him about lucie but paul did not mind that he rather liked it now that the murder was out presently when paul had gone off to play and the verneys were sitting at a little table by themselves on the terrace monsieur verney suddenly fell into a brown study and after a few minutes bringing his fist down on the table and making the glasses ring said to madame verney i know who that little girl is nowi could not place her at first she is the halfsister of madame ravenel the child is allowed to visit her once a yearwhat can the family be thinking of to permit it madame verney knew sophie ravenels history perfectly well as did everybody in bienville and she knew more than most people for she said to monsieur verney at the time when madame delorme left her husband for ravenel this child whom she had brought up from her birth was taken away from her by her grandmother their fathers mother who is also the grandmother of madame ravenel this little girls mother was an american i am told the child i know has been permitted to visit madame ravenel before but this will scarcely be allowed after she is two or three years older i have also heard that she has a large fortune through her mother in her own right at this the great maternal instinct welled up in madame verneys heart why should not her paul the best of boys marry a girl with a large fortune and a position like lucies which was far above pauls she began to dream about pauls matrimonial prospectsdreams which had begun when he was a little pink baby lying in his cradle the verneys were not rich nor distinguished nor was there anything except love which would be likely to provide paul with a wife suitable to his merits madame verney following up this dream concerning paul began secretly to pity madame ravenel and argued that after all nothing about that unfortunate lady could reflect on lucie meanwhile lucie kneeling down on the edge of the basin of the fountain looked into it and saw there a church brilliantly lighted with palms and flowers all about and full of gailydressed ladies and officers in uniform and then the organ sounded and up the aisle came marching herself in a white satin gown and lace veil and she leaned on the arm of a young officer with a sword and a helmet with a horsehair plume in it and he had the honest eyes of paul verney at the end of the week lucie vanished from pauls sight but not from his memory according to all the laws of fitness paul the most honest straightforward matteroffact obedient little fellow in the world should have found his counterpart in the shape of another denise duval of his own class for little denise was as honest as correct as matteroffact and as obedient as paul verney but behold how it works paul fell in love with the vivacious sprightly charming lucie while toni had determined to link his fate with the irreproachable and demure denise the summer waned and the autumn began and then a great shock came to tonitwo great shocks in fact first paul verney who next to jacques was tonis best friend was sent away to boardingschool toni felt a horrible sense of loss and emptiness in losing paul he seemed to lose a protector as well as a friend he had not been so much afraid of other people when paul was about but now he was more afraid of them than ever and then toni being a strong robust fellow for his age it was forced upon madame marcel that as he would not go to school he must learn a trade madame marcel was ambitious for toni and shed many tears over his determination not to make a walking encyclopedia of himself if he could help it what was the use of his learning to work anyhow when he married denise as he fully intended to do they could live over mademoiselle duvals shop and eat cakes and tarts for dinner and candies for breakfast and supper there was the bench under the acacia tree close by mademoiselle duvals shop and toni expected to spend his adult life sitting on that bench in the summer time with denise and eating cakes and in the winter time sitting in his mothers warm kitchen licking candy kettles it was a very grave matter to select a trade for toni madame marcel had aspirations for him which were not shared however by anybody else for all the persons with whom she talked concerning tonis future were quite brutal so his poor mother thought and recommended putting the boy to doing hard work for which his strong little legs and arms and back well fitted him but madame marcel secretly yearned to see her toni a gentleman though at the same time she had not the courage to advance this proposition in any way so she thought as a compromise between a trade and a profession she would make toni a musiciana violinist in short when this was broached to toni he objected to it as he did to every suggestion that he should do anything except amuse himself talk with jacques and hang around the horses at the cavalry barracks his mother however for once showed some determination and toni finding that he absolutely had to learn to work begged and prayed that he might be allowed to work about the one livery stable in the town of bienville toni really did not think he would mind feeding and currying horses he loved them so muchalmost as much as jacques and paul verneyand like jacques they were interested listenersmore interested than most of the people he knew madame marcel would by no means consent to this and urged on toni the advantage of playing first violin in the orchestra of the theater like hermann the yellowhaired swiss who was first violinist at the bienville theater do you call that work asked toni indignantly as if he were already a captain of industrysitting there and fiddling for amusement why mama that isnt work at allits just amusement then why do you object to it asked madame marcel helplessly because it is not work replied toni boldly when i work i want to workcurrying horses or something but have you no ambition cried poor madame marcel do you want to be a mere hostler tonis mind had not projected itself very far he knew that he would have to serve his time in the army and it had occurred to him that he would certainly be put in the cavalry and he said as much to his mother but madame marcel who could not persuade herself that toni was not an innocent and guileless creature could not endure the thought of turning him loose in a stable to bear the kicks and cuffs the jokes and jeers of a lot of rough stablemen she asked toni if he would be willing to learn the trade of a tailor clery the tailor lived opposite them and was a very respectable man who made a good living for his family but toni hastily objected to thishe was afraid of the five clery boys so madame marcel and toni kept going around in a circle for many days and weeks finally madame marcel one morning taking toni by his hand having washed him clean for once and dressed him in his best sunday suit carried him off to see monsieur hermann the swiss in regard to converting toni into a second sarasate or ysaye hermann lived in two little rooms at the top of a rickety old tenement and tonis heart sank as he climbed the stairs holding on tightly to his mothers hand he did not like hermanns looksa big blueeyed swiss who imagined that he resembled lohengrin and siegfried and dressed the part as well as he was able by cultivating a head of long curly blond hair and a huge blond beard madame marcel explained as mothers are apt to do under similar circumstances that finding toni totally unfitted for anything else she had determined to make a musician of him hermann smiled there was nothing of the artistic temperament visible in that tousled head of black hair those bright dark eyes which changed their expression as quickly as the little river under the stone bridge changed its look on an april day of sun and rain and toni had hard muscular little hands which did not seem to hermann as if they could ever wield the magic bow toni himself looked sulky he had no mind to be a fiddler and did not mean to learn however his mother arranged that he should go the next day to take his first lesson and then they went down stairs toni clattering ahead he rushed off to the cavalry barracks at the other end of the town it was the time for feeding the hundreds of horses in the long rows of stalls and toni had a few happy moments crawling in and out as the troopers would let him quite regardless of the sunday suit oh if he could only live with horses all the time instead of people now that paul verney was gone he felt that it was useless for him to try to have a talking friend but horses could understand perfectly well and he could find much greater companionship in a horse than in a fiddle he firmly resolved not to go next morning to take his music lesson if he could possibly help it but when the time came he could not help it and he started off at a snails pace for hermanns lodging hermann leaning out of his window saw toni come slouching along looking as if he were going to his execution he scowled at hermann leaning out of the window few small boys love lessons on the violin which is a difficult instrument but well worth giving ones days and nights to thought hermann when toni finally appeared he was the image of stolidity and stupidity hermann put a violin in his hands and tried to explain the scale to him but toni was hopelessly inept he could not understand those queerlooking things called notes his mind wandered to the ridingschool where he knew the troopers were going through their exercises he thought of the day he took that glorious wild ride on the old cavalry charger he began to wonder what paul verney was doing and reflected that it would be well for him to frame an excuse some time that day to go into mademoiselle duvals shop so she would give him a bun illustration told him to go home to his mother and tell her that she had an ass for a son it may be imagined to what a pass tonis state of mind reduced poor hermann who finally rapped him smartly over the head with the violin bow and told him to go home to his mother and tell her that she had an ass for a son toni at the first rap from the bow which did not hurt him in the least howled terrifically and rushing off home to his mother told her between his sobs a harrowing tale of how hermann had beaten him most cruelly with the violin bow however madame marcel could not find a scratch on him to corroborate tonis sensational tale and flatly refused to believe him in spite of tonis protests he was sent back to hermanns lodgings for his music book and the little violin which madame marcel had asked hermann to provide for the boy he returned home carrying both music book and violin those instruments of torture and seriously considered studying tailoring after all as two of the clery boys were doing but clery made his boys work and toni had great hopes that hermann would never be able to get any work out of him little denise who was softhearted had seen him coming and going in his pursuit of an artistic career and her heart was touched at the spectacle of tonis unhappiness when he came home that second day denise was sitting on the bench under the acacia tree and was knitting industriously denise had all the virtues which toni lacked as toni approached his head hanging sullenly down denise held out her hand and in it was a little piece of stale tart this brightened toni up and sitting down by denise he told her a moving story of the cruelties he had suffered at hermanns hands adding several atrocities to the original ones poor poor toni i feel so sorry for you you ought to replied toni deeply touched by his own eloquence and beginning to cry that man will beat me to death some day i know he will and i hope he will too because then even my mother will be sorry she sent me to learn the fiddle ooooh mademoiselle duval interrupted this tender scene by coming out and calling to toni you goodfornothing little boy why dont you go home and practise the violin and mind your mother oh i warrant madame marcel will see trouble with you toni concluded that when he married denise he would see as little as possible of his auntinlaw as well as his fatherinlaw he went back the next day and many days after for weeks and months honest hermann strove with the boy but toni simply would not learn the violin however a strange thing happenedhe found he could talk to hermann and was not afraid of him and hermann discovered that this lazy idle dirty brighteyed insinuating urchin who had no ear for music had some strangely companionable qualities toni even grew intimate enough with hermann to tell him all about jacques and actually was courageous enough to show that redoubtable warrior to his friend he told hermann also of his friendships with horses and said to him do you know i feel as if you were a horsea great big sorrel carthorse hermann threw back his head and opened his great mouth and laughed at this and i am not the least afraid of you continued toni and that is very queer because i am so afraid of people except paul verney and shall i tell you said hermann laughing and twisting his hands in the boys shock of black hair what i think you are like a monkeyexcept that you have not sense enough to learn to dance as a monkey does toni was delighted at this then he said quite gravely do you know monsieur hermann of any business a boy can learn that will give him all he wants to eat and plenty of time to amuse himself and not make him work and support him oh yes said hermann marry a young lady with a large fortune that gives a man enough to do but yet it is not called work i had already made up my mind to that said toni seriously i am goingnow dont tell anybody thisi am going to marry little denise duval and we are going to live part of the time with mademoiselle duval and eat cakes and the rest of the time with my mother and eat candies hoho laughed hermann who had a great big joyous laugh what a clever arrangementand mademoiselle duval has agreed to this and her niece and your mother my mother will agree to anything i say and mademoiselle duval will agree to anything denise says but i have not asked denise yetshe is so young you know she doesnt understand anything about these things but i shall marry her just the same if i ever have a wife i mean that she shall be nice and clean and good and stay at home and work hard women ought to work hard you know monsieur hermann hermann shouted out againhis great roaring laugh you are after all not such a little idiot as i supposed he said mademoiselle denise will no doubt work and keep you in idleness now play your scaleand then toni played his scalea terrible scale that began and ended nowhere and which caused hermann to grind his teeth he caught toni and shook him play that scale again you little rascal he roared and toni played it worse than before oh my god cried hermann to think of teaching you the violin i might just as well try to teach one of the horses in the ridingschooli am sure any of the horses could play as well as you do toni listened to this and was pleased he had no notion of learning to play the violin but he had learned to like coming to hermanns lodging and talking about all sorts of things particularly as he had no one else whom he could talk to meanwhile madame marcel was delighted when she found that toni after a while grew to make no objections to going to take his music lesson he learned so little however that hermann who was an honest fellow began to have conscientious scruples about taking madame marcels money for tonis lessons at the end of six months hermann went to madame marcel and told her frankly that toni could never become a sarasate or an ysaye and made the same comparison about teaching a horse to play the fiddle as easily as he could teach toni madame marcel looked at him with wondering eyes toni professed to be so anxious to learn that young person had discovered that spending an hour each day doing nothing with hermanns big kindly face to look into and being able to tell things to some one who could understand as paul verney did was really a great scheme then he would always spend another hour going the halfmile to hermanns house and an hour coming back and he could always invent a plausible excuse for taking so long and he had no mind in the world to give up his oncedreaded music lessons but he is so fond of his music pleaded madame marcel he loves to take his lesson oh god cried hermann that boy is fooling you madame marcel he fooled me for a little while but he is not learning anythinghe does not mean to learn anything he likes you so much wailed madame marcel and i like himthe idle little rascal replied hermann goodhumoredly he is the queerest little chap and i like to talk to him you are paying your good money for that madame marcelhe is not learning to play the violinhe never will learn madame marcel sighed and a great gloom fell on her she thought she had solved the problem of tonis future and here it was rising up before her even more complex and more appalling than before do you think it would do any good she asked anxiously if i were to whip toni not a bit madame replied hermann perhaps if you let me thrash him this was the second proposal of the kind which madame marcel had received the other one being that offer of sergeant duvals to become a father to toni and to give him all the thrashings he richly deserved some idea of the same sort flashed into her head and at the same moment it came into hermanns mind he had grown so unreasonably fond of the little rascal and what a pity it was that the boy should not be made to learn and to behave himself so he said sentimentally to madame marcel with almost the same words and exactly the same meaning which sergeant duval had madame you ought to marry in order that toni may have a mans strong hand to control him if i could aspirefor hermann was as poor as poverty and madame marcel with her candy shop was comfortably off for a widow with one child madame marcel shook her head sergeant duval was far more attractive to her than this big hulking blond violinist but not even the dashing sergeant could win her on his promise to give toni his deserts no monsieur said madame marcel fingering her apron as girlish blushes came into her face i am not thinking of changing my condition my life shall be devoted to toni and as i firmly believe that he has great talent for music and really tries to learn if you will continue to let him go to you i shall be delighted and consider it a favor from you very well madame replied hermann in a tone of resignation if you wish to throw your money away you may pay it to me for god knows i need it but i assure you i might just as well undertake to teach the town pump to play the violin as your toni and toni has no more notion of learning to play than the town pump has good morning madame toni in this affair scored a brilliant victory over his mother and hermann for two whole years more he kept up this delightful farce of learning to play the violin and in that time he learned one little air sur le pont davignon which he played in a most excruciating manner flatting his notes terrifically and playing with a reckless disregard of time which almost broke poor hermanns heart when toni played this air for the first time before his mother on a summer afternoon the good soul began to doubt for the first time whether toni could be made a great musician sergeant duval happening to be at home on his annual leave heard these strange sounds proceeding from madame marcels kitchen behind the shop and came over in great alarm explaining that he heard weird noises and feared that madame marcel had perhaps fallen into a fit madame marcel was highly offended at this notion of tonis performance and directed toni to play  sur le pont davignon  for the sergeant who listened gravely to tonis scraping and caterwauling his only comment on it being i have known a man to be shot for less than that in the summer paul verney came home from boardingschool he was much taller and broader than he had been before much improved in mind but the same kind brave gentle paul he was overjoyed to see toni again and the two lads on meeting hugged each other or rather toni hugged paul for although paul was tenderhearted he was undemonstrative and felt the dignity of his fourteen years and his two terms at boardingschool not so with toni who had no sense of personal dignity whatever at once their old relations were established and the two lads spent many hours together as they had done in summers past cuddled together on the abutment of the bridge and telling each other long stories paul of his experiences at boardingschool and toni stories of what jacques had told him and what hermann had told him and what the horses told him and what he meant to be when he was a man he confided to paul the charm of learning to play the violin and shocked pauls honest soul by the frank acknowledgment that learning the violin was a means to avoid going to work but this made no difference in pauls feelings he hated dirty idle boys in general but loved the dirty idle toni and being by nature correct methodical and orderly he adored the two most unconventional creatures ever put into this world little lucie bernard and toni in due time lucie also came for her annual visit accompanied by the woodenfaced harper the nursery governess lucie sometimes passed paul in the street and always bowed and smiled at him in the most captivating way which caused pauls face to turn scarlet and sent his boyish pulses galloping he confided to his mothers ear that lucie had arrived and for the fortnight that she stayed he haunted the park every afternoon he was now promoted to long trousers and felt his dignity very much he longed for an opportunity to talk with lucie but as the case often is all the arrangements for private interviews had to be made by the lady lucie was an ingenious little person and not easily daunted and it was not many days before she managed to escape from harpers eagle eye and from madame ravenels gentle supervision and to come upon paul walking soberly along the path and secretly wishing for her how do you do monsieur verney said lucie dropping him a pretty little curtsey how tall you are paul bowed and managed to say you too have grown mademoiselle indeed i have answered lucie briskly and next year my hair is to be plaited she shook her rich brown locks that hung down to her waist and were tied halfway with a bright scarlet ribbon and paul thought in his heart it was a shame to hide such beautiful hair in a plait such as little denise duval wore and the tailors children and he much preferred lucies hair hanging free with the scarlet bow bobbing up and down and then the dancing scarlet bow seemed in some way to match her eyes which had a gleam of fire in them and which were always dancing and full of life and her little sensitive mouth which was always smiling i hear you have been to boardingschool said lucie yes mademoiselle answered paul quite timidly as if he were the young lady and lucie the bold and ardent suitor i suppose you think yourself quite a man oh no mademoiselle i am only a boy yet i dont go to schooli have masters said lucie and a visiting governess who comes to the chateau bernard to teach me geography and history and thingsbut let me tell you paulhere lucie dropped into a confidential tone and came quite close to paul and put her rosy lips to his ear i dont like to learn anything except english and music english is no trouble at all because sophie always spoke english to me and i love music although it is very hard work but sophie made me practise on the piano until i can play it quite well but for the other thingsi dont care whether i know them or not my governess goes and complains to grandmama that i wont learn and then grandmama sends for me and scolds me and then i kiss her and tell her i will do better and that makes grandmama happybut i dont care to learn out of books paulthat is the truthi like to read stories but they wont let me read stories not even sophie paul looked at lucie and sighed heavily was she another toni masquerading in girls clothes he could not understand to save his life these children who did not like to study and learn and why they would not try to please their governesses and parents by trying nor could he understand why the two beings destined to be nearest to his soul should be so different in these respects from his ideals paul could not fathom this but it troubled him very much indeed and forthwith he said a few words to lucie something like those he had said to toni oh mademoiselle one ought to learnindeed one shouldparticularly if your grandmother and your sister sophie wish you to do it i dont mind learning in the leasti am going into the army and if i dont study and cant pass the army examinations i shall have to be a clerk or something of that sortmy parents are not rich you knowso i must learn all i can tra la la cried lucie stopping in the path and doing a skirt dance fluffing her voluminous little skirts up and down as she had seen a young lady do at the circus you are a boy and you have to learn who was that blackeyed dirty little boy i saw walking with you on the street the other day that was toni answered paul and proceeded to tell who toni was and is he fond of learning too asked lucie not a bit sighed paul then he must be just like me paul burst into a sudden fit of laughter at the idea of toni and lucie being alike lucie seemed to him like a little princess out of a storybook i will tell you what paul said she when i am eighteen as i told you once before i shall have heaps and heaps of money from america that i can do with as i please and nobody can stop me and i made up my mind a long time ago that i am coming to bienville to live with sophie and captain raveneloh i do love them so muchthey are so good to me then you will be an officer and you will have a beautiful sword and a helmet with a horsehair plume in it like the officers i see walking about here and then i shall go to a ball and some one will bring you up and introduce you to me and say mademoiselle may i introduce lieutenant verney and then i shall bow to you as if i never saw you before and then you will say mademoiselle will you do me the honor to give me this dance and we shall dance together and then when nobody can hear we shall talk about having known each other always and it will be our secret and no one will know it but ourselves wont it be charming paul looked at lucie with a new strange light in his eyes lucie although quite unknown to herself was much further along the path to womanhood than paul was to manhood but she seemed to be showing him some charming prophetic vision and you must not mention to a soul said lucie that you ever spoke one word to me before and i will not tell any one that i ever spoke one word to you before i was afraid to tell sophie that i had talked with you because she would be vexed with me and would not give me another chance to get away from her so let us agree never to mention each others names to any one but every summer we shall meet at bienville and then when we are grown up we shall be introduced but we shall know each other all the time and then when nobody is listening i shall call you paul and you will call me lucie more strange new delicious feelings crept into the boys heart as lucie said these words paul and lucie he knew very well that when grown people called each other by their names they were very intimate and how sweet it would be to know lucie well enough for that and besides if they never called each other by their names except when they were alone they would escape being teased so paul said calling her for the first time by her name lucie you wont forget this will you no paul said lucie suddenly dropping her gay and saucy air and speaking quite sweetly and demurely and then having turned a leaf in the book of life they parted lucie heard harpers voice calling her and paul hurried away his heart full of a singular rapture how enticing the future looked to him how he longed to be a man and an officer and he meant to be a good officer too so that people would praise him to lucie he hurried through the park and past the edge of the town into the fields beyond and on to the stone bridge and climbing up into the place where he and toni had so often huddled together sat there lost in a delicious dream it was an august afternoon and the summer air was still and perfumed in the purple woods on the other side of the water the birds were chirping sweetly and under the bridge the little fishes were tumbling about in the dark water all these sights and sounds entered into the boys soul the bell had been rung for the curtain to go up for this boy on the great tragicomedy of human life he sat there until the shadows grew long and the west was flaming when looking at the silver watch in his pocket he realized that it was almost suppertime and that he would have to run home to keep his mother from being uneasy so he started at once as he scampered along the street in which toni lived he saw standing under an acacia tree close by mademoiselle duvals shop toni and denise duval denise as clean as modest as pretty as ever was generously dividing a bun with toni and tonioh wonderwas giving denise two whole sticks of candy only biting off one small piece for himself paul stopped astounded at the spectacle usually it was toni who gobbled up everything which denise gave him and now oh miracle toni was voluntarily giving up something to denise it was in truth an epochmaking day in tonis life during the rest of lucies visit she and paul several times spoke together and every time it was paul who said to her lucie dont forget that when we grow up we are to call each other paul and lucieand every time lucie responded dont you forget paul paul who secretly mourned over lucies depravity talked to her quite seriously about refusing to learn geography and spelling and arithmetic and other rudiments of a young ladys education lucie listened and for the first time in her life felt herself impelled by a will stronger than her own none of the governesses and masters who had ever taught her had been able to impress her with the necessity of learning nor indeed did paul for that matter because lucie by no means considered that geography and spelling and arithmetic were essential to a polite education but paul had an influence over her nay a sort of authority as lucie gazed at him she gradually acquired an expression that a dog has for a kind master for the first time in her life she found it easier to give up her own will than to persist in it this feeling was but a gleam but it was not evanescent illustration giving denise two whole sticks of candy it was one of the happiest visits lucie had ever paid in bienville for sophie seemed a little more like her old self and captain ravenel too was more cheerful the story of the stand that colonel duquesne had taken about madame ravenel had leaked out mysteriously and there was no danger of any further impertinence being offered sophie ravenel the retired and blameless and selfsacrificing life the ravenels led was beginning to be known the ultravirtuous still hounded madame ravenel over their teacups in the winter and their ices in the summer but although no one had invaded the retirement of the ravenels so far a number of people had begun the practice of speaking to them as they passed and they were no longer avoided they even reached the point of courage to go sometimes and sit on the terrace where the band played and where the people sat at little tables eating and drinking one afternoon shortly after lucie had left they were actually invited to sit at the same table with the verneys the ravenels walked on the terrace evidently looking for a table but there was not a vacant one there were however two unoccupied seats where monsieur and madame verney and paul sat drinking  eau sucre  the ravenels were about to leave when madame verney whispered something to her husband monsieur verney at first shook his head but madame verney persisted that dream of her paul marrying the beautiful charming heiress into which lucie bernard was certain to develop had haunted the good womans brain and she urged her husband in a whisper to invite the ravenels to take the two vacant seats monsieur verney like a good obedient husband could not hold out long against his wife and when the ravenels passed not dreaming that any one in bienville would share a table with them monsieur verney rose and said politely if you are looking for a place monsieur there are two chairs vacant herewe shall be most happy if you will occupy them ravenel stopped amazed and the color poured into sophie ravenels beautiful pale face and in an instant more they were seated with the verneys the first social recognition they had had since that day when delormes blow drove sophie into ravenels arms after thanking monsieur and madame verney the ravenels gave their modest order and then according to the polite manner of the french they began to talk together captain ravenel at once recognized paul and made the boys heart leap with delight and this young gentleman i recollect well as having been most polite and attentive to madame ravenel once when she fell ill in the park the verneys had known nothing of pauls share in that scene and did not identify him at all with that memorable occasion which was known all over bienville when sophie ravenel had been so cruelly insulted so monsieur and madame verney beamed with delight while captain ravenel gravely thanked paul the boy gazed at madame ravenels refined and melancholy beauty and felt a renewal of the charm which she exercised over all sensitive natures then his heart began to beat furiously as his mother said i have often admired madame the little girl that i have seen with you in the parkyour sister i believe yes replied sophie my little halfsister of whom i had the charge during all her babyhood and who is like a child to both of us she is very very pretty said madame verney hoping that embodied prettiness would one day belong to her paul together with all that went with it and very goodhearted replied sophie smiling she is not a french childmy stepmother was american and lucie is like her unconventional and even wilful but good and tenderhearted beyond any creature that i have ever known she lives with our grandmother and grandmothers you know are not very severe mentors so i am afraid my little sister does not get as good discipline as she would have had if her mother had lived and when she comes to visit us captain ravenel spoils her so sophie stopped turning her full soft gaze on captain ravenel she thought him the best the noblest of men and did not love him the less because he was so indulgent to lucie monsieur verney putting his hand on pauls shoulder told captain ravenel that there was the future murat of the french army pauls father was always joking him but the boy did not mind it in the least and laughed at the notion of being a great cavalry officer so you are going into the cavalry eh asked captain ravenel why not the artillery ravenel himself had been an artillery officer because i am not clever enough i am afraid replied paul frankly an officer has to be very clever to be in the artilleryclever at his books i mean and i am not very clever at my books we do not complain said monsieur verney in response to this speech he does very well at his books but he has always wished to be in the cavalry so i presume that is where he will land eventually after a little while the ravenels rosethey were not persons who outstayed their welcomeand went away with gratitude in their hearts to the verneys this was a little thing but it was the entering wedge of something like social recognition in bienville the next time they met on the terrace it was monsieur verney who with madame asked permission to sit at the table with the ravenels captain ravenel in the course of the conversation mentioned some pictures he had of the arab tribesmen in algeria monsieur verney spoke of them to paul next day and the boy begged that he might ask captain ravenel to show him the pictures monsieur verney consented and that afternoon paul finding the ravenels taking their accustomed walk went up and according to his habit blushing very much said that his father had given him permission to ask captain ravenel to show him his arab pictures captain ravenel promptly appointed the next morning after breakfast and paul presented himself at half after eleven he was the first visitor of their own class who had darkened the door of the ravenels since they came to bienville captain ravenel not only showed him the pictures but talked to him so interestingly that the boy went home captivated moreover he told his father that some things which seemed so hard for him to learn at school captain ravenel had made quite clear to him and it came to monsieur verneys mind that it would be a good thing to get captain ravenel to coach paul an hour or two every day during his holidays madame verney rapturously approved of this the vision of lucie hovered over it all the arrangement was soon made and during the rest of his holidays for two hours every day paul sat with captain ravenel in the garden on pleasant days but in the salon when it was disagreeable and studied mathematics and geography with him never was there so attentive a boy and the verneys were charmed and delighted at the progress paul made in his studies he was naturally of a determined and plodding nature and ravenel was a good instructor but there was another motive urging paul on ravenel was lucies brotherinlaw and when that glorious day came when lucie would be a young lady living in bienville and paul would be a young lieutenant of cavalry calling her in public mademoiselle bernard and in secret lucie it would be a very good thing for him to be in favor with captain ravenel and also with madame ravenel pauls politeness and courtesy the promptness with which his cap came off his reddish hair when he saw madame ravenel the way in which he flew to open the door or the gate for her the gentleness of his behavior made sophie his friend as much as captain ravenel in spite of his two hours work every day with captain ravenel paul found plenty of opportunity still to be with toni they maintained their attitude of confidence toward each other as regarded their different ladyloves and about this time toni confessed to paul that strange and thorough revolution that had taken place in his nature by which he had for the first time in his life given to another person something which he might have gobbled up himself in giving denise nearly all of his two sticks of candy paul commended this highly in toni and said to him boys should always give girls the preference in things like that my father always gives my mother all the chicken liversthat is the way with gentlemen but toni added paul frankly and seriously i am afraid you are not a gentleman and never will be one no indeed answered toni i am no gentlemani dont want to be a gentlemani am only toni but i like denise almost as much as you do mademoiselle lucie at first i meant to marry denise just because her aunt keeps a pastry shop but nowhere toni expanded his chest and looked hard at paulbut now i believe that is i almost believe i could marry denise even if her aunt didnt keep a pastry shop you see denise is so very clean and i like clean little girls toni at that moment had gathered on his person all the dirt possible in spite of the earnest efforts of madame marcel in a contrary direction his hands were grimy there was a smudge on his nose and his blue overalls which had been clean that very morning were all mud and tatters a more disreputablelooking boy than toni did not exist in bienville paul realizing the incongruity between tonis sentiments and his appearance burst out laughing but toni did not mind being laughed at and grinned himself in sympathy i know i am dirty he said but i dont mindi am no gentleman pauls holidays were to end in september and the verneys out of goodwill to captain ravenel and after much serious cogitation invited captain and madame ravenel to drink tea with them one afternoon in their garden it was a small thing apparently this drinking tea with the advocate and his wife who were neither rich nor important people in bienville but it meant the rehabilitation of the ravenels in these years of seclusion both of them had grown timid and sophie rather shrank from appearing once more in that world in which she had shone so beautifully but ravenel through the point of view of a man of sense desired sophie to go and his will was law with her so on the afternoon before paul left the ravenels went over and in the little arbor in the verneys garden had tea together paul made one of the party and also toni unseen by anybody except paul there was a hole in the hedge which was close to the summerhouse and outside that hole toni crouched at one or two points in the banquet which consisted of cakes and fruit as well as tea paul made excuses to pass the hedge and every time he handed through the hole a cake or some fruit to toni and what was the strangest thing in the world toni ate the cakes himself and put the fruit into a paper bag which he had brought for the purpose the third and last time when paul surreptitiously handed a couple of figs through the hole toni held up the bag and whispered for denise paul nearly dropped with astonishment but this was not the only surprise of the afternoon the summerhouse was near the open iron gate of the garden and as the grown people were sitting quietly chatting and drinking their tea colonel duquesne passed by and stopping in front of the gate tried to light his cigar but used up the last match in his matchbox without being able to do it then monsieur verney who was the soul of goodwill and hospitality taking from the table some of the matches madame verney used for her teakettle walked to the gate and offered them to colonel duquesne there was a breeze stirring enough to make it difficult to light a cigar out of doors and monsieur verney invited colonel duquesne to come into the summerhouse the colonel looking in and seeing madame verney smiling and bowing and the ravenels sitting there accepted monsieur verneys invitation and went in walking up he spoke gallantly to madame verney and to captain and madame ravenel quite as if he knew nothing about that past which had wrecked their lives he did more when madame verney pressed him to accept a cup of tea he sat down at the teatable and made himself most agreeable addressing captain ravenel without effusion but quite as an old comrade in arms such a thing neither of the ravenels had ever hoped or looked for and the verneys who were the besthearted people in the world were delighted at the success of their invitation colonel duquesne sat for half an hour and at last lighting his cigar he departed as he went down the street he shook his gray head and said to himself if i had a wife or a daughter what a wigging i should get when i go home the next day paul was to go back to school and early in the morning he and toni had their last interview in the little cranny on the bridge it was a beautiful bright september morning but both boys were rather low in spirits no boy that ever lived not even so excellent a one as paul verney goes back to school with a light heart but paul made the best of it toni was depressed at the thought of being reduced again to the society of hermann as the only person who could understand and reply to his talk for although jacques and the horses were equally as intelligent as hermann they were not so responsive illustration had their last interview in the little cranny on the bridge and now toni paul urged pray try and learn to play the violin or do something to make a living toni shook his head dolefully i dont like making a living and besides if i marry denise whats the use denise will take care of mei know she will she and my mother will make a living for me paul felt perfectly hopeless at this speech of tonisthere was no doing anything with him paul returned to school and toni went back to his music lessons but with no better success than before he was now quite twelve years old and he had become a public scandal in the town of bienville even old marie who sat by the monument scolded him for his idleness at last madame marcel actuated by the press of public opinion was forced to put toni to work as a great favor clery the tailor took toni on trial with a view to making him a professor of the sartorial art clerys two sons aged twelve and fourteen could already make each a respectable pair of trousers and madame marcel tearfully laying aside her ambitions implored clery to make toni a replica of the clery boys toni was frightened half to death at the prospect of going into a tailors shop and his mother had literally to drag him there on the morning when he was to be inducted into his new profession the shop was a small room where two or three sewingmachines were perpetually going there sat clery and his two boys at work for the first week or two toni was employed in carrying parcels which he found onerous enough he had a way however of taking an hour to do an errand which ought only to have taken him ten minutes and when during that first week in the tailors shop he was intrusted with a pair of captain ravenels wellworn trousers which had been pressed and cleaned and it took him fiftyseven minutes to carry them from clerys shop to the ravenels door which was exactly four minutes away clery said that would never do as for toni these long absences from the shop meant getting back to his old haunts and to the things he was not afraid ofthe bridge by the river and the sight of a cavalry troop going out for exercise or a conversation with jacques by way of encouragement he had a feeling of terror when he sat in the shop with the tailors eye fixed on him and the two boys industriously sewing away on the sewingmachine and eying him with contempt he sat there this wild and reckless toni who was thought to fear neither god nor man nor beast the most frightened little boy imaginable he could not have told to save his life what he was afraid of but he knew that he was afraidso much so that he stayed with clery a whole year in that time he learned absolutely nothing except to carry parcels which he knew before if it had not been for the regard that clery had for madame marcel he would not have kept toni a fortnight as it was he found it impossible to teach toni the smallest thing about the tailoring trade he could not operate a sewingmachine to save his life nor learn to sew a stitch or to handle a smoothingiron clery who knew what a problem it was thought long and anxiously over this problem of madame marcels all through the winter days he kept his eye on toni hoping that the boy might learn something but when the leaves came in the spring toni knew no more about tailoring than he did when the autumn winds swept the trees bare it was then may and toni was finding the confinement of the shop almost more than his soul could bear it seemed to him impossible that such a life should continue away from the fresh air away from the damp sweetsmelling earth away from horses and troopers he could not even see denise for clery had taught him one thing and that was not to loiter by the wayside and sometimes a whole week would pass without his having a word with the lady of his love and denise with the clairvoyance of childhood saw in the troubled depths of tonis black eyes that he was soulsick and in her tender heart she felt sorry for him sometimes she would lie in wait for toni under the branches of the acacia tree and hand him out a tart or a piece of ginger bread but even this had no taste in tonis mouthlife was so dark and drear to him how he longed for those happy days when he scraped and talked in hermanns garret or those still better days when there was no thought of work and he could spend the whole day if he liked lying on his stomach on the parapet of the bridge and watch the silvery backs of the fishes as they tumbled about in the rippling water it seemed to him as if denise was the only soul in the world who understood and pitied him even his mother who he had hoped would let him live in idleness all his days had done this strange and cruel thing of trying to make him work paul verney wished him to work clery made him work the clery boys openly despised him for not working only denise of everybody in the wide world knew what toni himself knewthat he was never meant to work toni was now thirteen years old and though short was very lithe and well made he had never been on a horses back since that glorious day when the old cavalry charger had run off with him and he had not been able to enjoy the society of the horses much or to lurk around the ridingschool since his apprenticeship to clery on a certain may day which although toni did not know it was a day of fate to him he saw the greatest sight of his lifethe debarkation of a circus company with all its horses and other animals at the little station in bienville toni had often seen recruits debark when they came to the cavalry school for instruction clumsy awkward fellows they wereat first ridiculously uneasy on a horse and often as much afraid of a horse as toni was of people and he had seen them return fine dashinglooking troopers after having been licked into shape in the ridingschool he loved to see the horses led to the trainthey were so intelligent so orderly and seemed like real comrades of the troopers but he had never seen anything like the trained intelligence of the circus horses in his life and on this may day when he wandered down to the station and saw horses who obeyed the word of command like human beings in getting off the train and taking up their right places he was astounded and delighted every boy in bienville was at the station to see the circus arrive but toni according to his habit slunk off by himself there were numerous cages of animals in which the other boys took a much greater interest than in the horses but the other animals were nothing to toni to whom the cult of the horse was everything he followed the circus people at a respectful distance to the large open field where they put up the tent but the chief point of interest to him was the temporary canvas stables which were erected he knew that it was time for him to go back to clerys but he could not to save his life have torn himself away from the fascinating sights and sounds which surrounded him everywhere was the bustle and wellregulated haste of such companies the circus which was really a small affair had arrived in the morning and the tent was up and the performance ready to open by two oclock toni spent the whole of the intervening time watching what was going on clery and the shop quite faded from his memory he saw the circus riders come out of the dressingtent in their beautiful costumes of red and gold and pink and silver a little tarnished but glorious in tonis eyes and he saw the horses gaily caparisoned and almost adored them if he had a single franc he would be able to go into the tent and see the performance but he had not a franc nor did he know where to get one exceptexcepthe knew where his mother kept a tin box full of francs he was afraid to go to her and ask her for the franc because he had not been near clerys shop that day and if his mother once caught him she might send him back to the shop and that would mean no circus for him that day but it was so easy to open the box and take out a franca thing he had never done before or thought of doing but like captain ravenel and sophie there are moments in the lives of human beings when temptation overwhelms the soul toni who was neither a thief nor a liar became both just as captain ravenel and sophie delorme had in one desperate moment trampled on the social law so toni to whom in spite of his faults deceit was as foreign even as it was to paul verney conceived the thought of taking a franc out of his mothers tin box he sneaked back home along bylanes and garden walls and crept in through the little back door which opened into the kitchen his mother was in the front shop and did not see him as he stole softly up the narrow stair into the bedroom above the sun was shining brightly and the clock on the mantel pointed to halfpast one toni always remembered this as an hour of fate the circus performance was to begin at two and he barely had time to find the key which his mother kept under the bureau cover and to unlock the press in which she kept her strong box to find the key to the strong box hanging up on a nail inside the press to open it and there in a smaller tin box to find many pieces of silver toni took out a single franc he might have taken the whole box but he never thought of it it was not money he wanted but a sight of the circus he then closed and replaced the box made everything as it was before and creeping down stairs rushed off to the field where the circus tent was up his heart beating with a wild excitement which was not joyneither was it pain the performance was almost ready to begin when toni handed in his franc with a trembling hand the place was full everybody in bienville seemed to be there and many persons from the surrounding country but toni managed to slip himself between two stout peasant women with baskets in their laps and contrived to see the whole performance without being seen he gave himself up a la toni to the enjoyment of the moment putting off until four oclock the hated interview with his mother and the still worse one that he must have with clery but the circus to him was a sight well worth a dozen whippings the view of the prancing horses so wonderfully intelligent the beautiful young ladies in gauze and spangles the riders in their satin suitsall were a dream to toni he did not see any of the grease spots on the costumes nor the paint on the faces of the lovely young ladies all was a foretaste of paradise it came to him in a moment what his real destiny wasto be a circus rider at once his imagination seized upon it he wondered himself that he had managed to exist so long without the circus all that vaulting and jumping and leaping that careering around on the backs of brave horses must be heavenlyit could not possibly be work illustration toni took out a single franc toni saw himself in imagination one of those glorious beings two things only did not fit into this picture which he drew of his futurehis mother and little denise he could not imagine either of them in the place of those shortskirted fluffyhaired young ladies with pink silk stockings and very stout legs just before the end a pony was brought out which succeeded in throwing three clowns so successfully that the audience was in roars of laughter the ringmaster challenged any one present below a certain weight to come out in the ring and try to ride this astonishing pony toni without his own volition and knowing no more of what he was doing than a sleepwalker wriggled out from between the two fat peasant women and got down in the sanded ring there was a roaring in his ears and a blur before his eyes and he could not have told how it was that he found himself upon the back of the kicking plunging pony careering around that dazzling circle all toni knew was that he was the ponys master there was no shaking him off shouts and cheers resounded each increasing as the pony still making desperate efforts to get rid of toni sped around the ring but toni held on as firmly and easily as if he had been born and bred in a ridingschool he had not the slightest sensation of fear any more than on that day so long ago when the old cavalry horse had run away with him the cheers and cries increased as the pony realizing that toni had the upper hand of him came down to a steady gallop the ringmaster advanced and cracked his whip a little and toni fully expected the pony to start anew the wild antics of the beginning instead of that the pony came to a dead halt which was expected to throw toni to the ground but did not he looked up however and caught sight of the ringmaster standing close to him he was a fiercelooking man with black eyes like tonis the sight of those eyes waked all the cowardice in tonis nature he thought he should have died of fright while that man was looking at him and then it came over him that hundreds of eyes were looking at him all the time he slipped off the ponys back and like a hunted creature dashed toward the nearest opening of the tent and fledfled homeward he meant to creep up stairs and crawl under his little bed and stay there until his mother came up stairs when he would catch her around the neck and tell her all about the franc and ask her yes actually ask her to give him a whipping just to restore things to their normal balance he felt that he deserved five hundred whippings as he raced homeward he passed clerys shop without looking that way suddenly clery himself darted out and seizing him dragged him through the shop and into a little back room quite dark clery who was an honest fellow meant to do toni the greatest service of his life and said holding him by the collar toni you are a thief toni in whose mind the paradise of circus land and the paroxysm of terror were rioting confusedly looked dreamily at clery who looked back sternly at him toni remaining silent clery shook him and hissed into his ear you are a thief you stole the money from your mother to go to the circus toni still said nothing and clery continued when you did not come back i knew that you had gone to the circus i went over and spoke to your mother and she told me she was sure you had not gone because you had no money then i saw you come back here and go out again and run away as fast as you could i went over and told your mother that you had been in the house but she declared that you had not my boy jean says he saw you running toward the house with both hands open and likewise your mouth and come out of it holding a franc between your teeth so toni you are a thief and your mother i am sure will never love you again and to keep you from being sent to prison for life i mean to give you as good a whipping as i am able for fear your mother will not do her duty by you and when i am through i will take you over to her and when i tell the police clery paused toni was thoroughly awake and alive then a thief tell the police that meant prison to him this awful vision drove everything else out of his mind and then clery suddenly brandishing the cane brought it down on tonis shoulders with all the strength of an ablebodied tailor toni uttered a halfshriek but after that neither cried out nor wept but bore stoically the blows that clery rained upon him it seemed as if the day of judgment had come when clery honest man had finished with toni and was taking him across the street toni looked around him with wild eyes of despair that precious refuge under his little bed seemed no longer open to him he was a thiefhe must go to prisonthat was all he knew and just then he looked up and there was a policeman walking straight toward him that was enough toni wresting himself from clerys grasp turned and ran like one possessed the specter of a mad fear chasing him down toward the bridge he was afraid to crawl into his usual nook because he could be easily seen from there so he ran across the bridge and hid himself in a thicket of young chestnut trees on the other side he lay terror stricken his heart beating so that he thought it must almost make a hole in the ground what was to become of him his mother as clery had told him could love him no longer he dared not look any one in the face but felt an outcast like cain he lay there for hours through the waning afternoon until the purple shadows descended on the white town on the sparkling river the long rows of barracks and the open fields in which the circus tent had been pitched it was now taken down and the circus people were preparing to go by the highway to the next town ten miles away it was nearly eight oclock and the young moon was trembling in the heavens when the circus cavalcade began to travel along the white and dusty highroad passing by tonis place of concealment it suddenly came into his mind that the only thing for him to do was to go with the circus as the end of the procession of carts and vans and horsemen and horsewomen passed toni crept out of his hidingplace and came up to a company of men who were trudging along on foot he said to one of them nicolas by name a youngish man with hair and beard as red as judas may i walk a little way with you this little way in tonis mind meant to walk through life with the circus company nicolas laughed runaway boys were the general concomitants of a circus company and in a moment more he recognized the boy who had stuck on the ponys back and then had run away so quickly yes come along you young rascal he said and you can carry this portmanteau if you likeand he slung the heavy portmanteau from his own shoulders to tonis toni trudged along carrying the portmanteau easily being a strong boy he got into a conversation with his new friend and soon expressed his determination to stay with the circus if only they would give him something to eat for he was very hungry a woman walking along with them heard this and handed toni a couple of biscuits which he eagerly devoured they trudged on for two hours the moon growing larger and brighter and flooding with a white radiance the hedges the wide fields the woods and the highway along which the cavalcade traveled slowly toni felt an immense sense of relief the police could not come so far to get him he hardened his heart against his mother he judged from what clery had told him that his mother would be the first to denounce him and so began poor tonis life with the circus away from his mother away from denise away from paul verneyonly jacques remained seven years afterward toni found himself one day at the little town of beaupre in the valley of the seine where the circus was performing for toni had remained with it all that time beautiful young ladies in spangles had come and gone demigods in red satin with white sashes had done the same toni himself was a demigod in red satin and a white sash and was the crack rider of the circus he had a large headline of letters a foot high all to himselfmonsieur louis dargens he was called on the billboards although everybody about the circus called him toni toni was then twenty years old and at least twenty years wiser than he had been seven years before one does not spend seven years in the circus without learning many things he learned all the immense wickednesses as well as the immense virtues which may be found in the lower half of humanity but like most demigods toni was not happy perhaps it was a part of the general quarrel which every human being has with fate but tonis principal quarrel was that he was haunted with fears of all sorts this madcap fellow this daring bareback rider this centaur of a man to whom nothing in the shape of horseflesh could cause the slightest tremor who could ride four horses at once and could do a great many other things requiring vast physical courage coolness and resolution was morally as great a coward as he had been in the old days when he ran away from all the boys in bienville except paul verney and ran away from home rather than face his mother after having taken a single franc he was mortally afraid of a number of persons of clery the tailor in faroff bienville for fear he might set the police on him of nicolas who had the upper hand of him completely and of a friend of nicolas pierre by name who was the most complete scoundrel unhung except nicolas himself both of these two men toni could have whipped with one hand tied behind his back for he was unusually muscular and though somewhat short a perfect athlete his two scampish friends nicolas and pierre were wretched objects physically such as men become who are born and bred in the slums who have behind them a halfstarved ancestry going back five hundred years and who are on intimate terms with the devil for a circus rider may practise every one of the seven deadly sins with perfect impunity except one that of drunkenness a circus rider must be sober they had drawn toni into many a scrape but here again tonis strange cowardice had saved him from taking an actual part in any wrongdoing he watched out for nicolas and pierre at their bidding he knew of their wrongdoing where they kept their stolen gains how they cheated the manager how they abused the women but toni himself although the associate of two such rogues and rascals and in many ways their blind tool had kept himself perfectly free from the commission of any crime or misdemeanor his heart remained goodpoor toni he still hankered mothersick for madame marcel once every year since he had run away he had written to her as well as he could for tonis literary accomplishments were very meager a letter all tearstained telling her he was well and trying to behave himself and he hoped she did not have rheumatism in her knees and that he was sorry for having stolen the franc he even sent her a little money once a year which madame marcel did not need but which toni did and in these letters he always sent his love to denise but he never gave his address nor any clue to his employment he was afraid to give any address for her to answer his letter and so did not really know whether his mother were alive or dead his heart still yearned unceasingly after paul verney the friend of his boyhood and none of the young ladies in tights and spangles had been able to put out of his mind little denise in her bluechecked apron and her plait of yellow hair hanging down her back and her downcast eyes and sweet way of speaking his name he never heard the churchbells ringing on a sunday morning that his bienville sundays did not come back to himhis mother washing and dressing him for church the sight of denise in her short white frock trotting along solemnly with her hand in mademoiselle duvals paul verney smartly dressed and hanging on to his fathers arm madame ravenel in her black gown standing just inside the church door with captain ravenel grave and sternlooking standing outsideand then the world in which toni lived seemed like a dream and this dream of bienville the only solid reality one friend remained to him the everfaithful jacques now battered almost beyond the semblance of a soldier toni continued his friendship for horses half of his success with them came from the perfect understanding of a horses heart and soul which toni possessed the other half came from that strange and total absence of fear where actual danger was concerned when the circus tent caught fire in the midst of a crowded performance toni was the calmest and most selfpossessed person there and careered around the ring doing his specialty a wonderful vaulting and tumbling act while the canvas roof overhead was blazing and no one but himself saw it when the bridge broke through with the circus train upon it toni was the first man to pull off his clothes and jump into the water and assisted in saving half a dozen lives he was regarded somewhat as a hero and daredevil while secretly he knew himself to be the greatest coward on the face of the earth nicolas and pierre knew this weakness of tonis from the beginning and traded on it most successfully illustration doing his specialty a wonderful vaulting and tumbling act the company was performing in the fields outside of beaupre but as they were playing a whole weeks engagement in the town some of them were quartered in the little hamlet close by within sight of the hamlets churchspire was a beautiful chateau standing all white and glistening in the sunlight surrounded by prim and beautiful gardens watched over by sylvan deities in marble on the broad terrace a fountain plashed and lower down a beautifullywooded park stretched out over the stone gateway leading into the park were the words chateau bernard the first time toni saw this was when he was on his way to the midday performance in the town of beaupre he stopped and the meaning of that name flashed into his mind in a second little lucie that charming little fairy whom paul verney loved so much and of whom he had confided blushingly and stumblingly some things to toni in those faroff days at bienville seven years before when he and paul had sat cuddled together on the abutment of the bridgethe sight of the name chateau bernard brought all this back to toni it was a beautiful bright spring morning like those mornings at bienville except that to toni the sun never shone so brightly anywhere as it had shone at bienville he stopped and gazed long at the chateau his black eyes as soft and sparkling as ever they had been although now he was a man grown but there was an eternal boyishness about him of which he could no more get rid than he could cease to be toni there had not been a day in all the years since he left bienville that he had not thought of paul verney and thinking of paul would naturally bring to his mind the beautiful little lucie who was like a dream maiden to himnot at all like denise who was to him a substantial though charming creature he reckoned that lucie must be now twenty and paul must be a sublieutenant as toni stood there his arms crossed and leaning on the stone wall he heard the clatter of horses hoofs and down the avenue came three riders a young girl and her escort in front and a groom behind as they dashed past toni he recognized in the slight willowy figure in the closefitting black habit and coquettish hat lucie bernard a young lady now but the same beautiful joyous sprite she had been ten years before in the park at bienville the cavalier riding with her was like toni below middle size but unlike toni lighthaired and blueeyed not handsome but better than handsomemanly intelligent clear of eye firm of seat full of life and energy and with an unstained youth it wasit waspaul verney as the two flashed past followed by the groom toni almost cried aloud in his agony of joy and pain but he dared not run after them and call to them they of course knew that he had run away from bienville because he was a thief that theft of a franc was perpetually gnawing at tonis heart the sight of paul verney seemed to show him the gulf between them toni stood leaning on the wall his head hanging down his mind and soul in a tumult for a long time until presently the sound of a clock striking through the open window of the keepers house aroused him to the knowledge that it was almost time for the circus to begin he ran nearly all the way to beaupre for he worked as honestly at his trade of a circus rideronly it did not seem like work to tonias paul verney did at his as a sublieutenant of cavalry but all that day through the performance during the intermission and at the afternoon performance and in the evening when toni went back to his little lodging in the village the vision haunted him lucie and paul looked so young so happy so fresh so innocent they had not behind them anything terrifying neither one of them had ever stolen anything unless it was the others heart they had no nicolas and pierre to make them stand watch while thefts were being committedto make them lie in order to shield rascally proceedingsalways to be threatening them with exposure toni was so tormented by these thoughts that he lay on his hard little bed in his garret lodging wideawake until midnight and then he was roused from his first light sleep by a pebble thrown at his window toni waked started up in his bed and shuddered that was the sign that nicolas and pierre wanted him they were his masters he knew it and they knew it he got up obediently however slipped on his clothes and went down the narrow stair noiselessly outside were his two friends come along said nicolas where are you going weakly asked toni we will tell you when we get there replied pierre with a grin there was no moon and the night was warm and sultry although it was only may toni followed his two friends along the highroad nicolas and pierre spoke to each other in low voices and toni easily made out that they were engaged on a scheme of robbery at that his soul turned sick with horror he had never robbed anybody of a single centime except that one solitary franc which he had taken from his mother but he knew more about robberies than most people the bare thought of them always frightened him inexpressibly but he continued trudging along without making any protest presently they came to the stone wall around the park of the chateau bernard over which they all scrambled and made straight for the chateau everything was quiet about it and apparently every one was asleep except in one room on the ground floor there were some gigantic luxuriant lilac bushes now in all their glory of bloom and perfume and under these the three crept never again could toni smell the lilac blooms without being overcome by a sickening recollection the window was open and within the small and luxuriouslyfurnished room they could see an old lady very splendidly dressed and a man of middle age toni at once recognized her from the description which paul and lucie had given him so many years before madame bernard was very large tall and handsome and sterner in aspect than both old marie who sat by the monument at bienville and the monument itself she was by far the grandestlooking person toni had ever seen and he did not suspect that she was as great a coward in her way as he was in his courage is a very variable quantity and subject to mysterious ebbs and tides some gold and banknotes were on a table before them and the old lady was saying weeping a little as she spoke i think you have behaved to me most cruelly count delorme whatever sophies faults were you got at least the benefit of her entire fortune which you squandered in your five years of marriage now you come here when my little lucie is at an age to be damaged by raking up this old story about sophie although you promised me if i would give you two thousand francs a year that you would never show yourself in this part of the country i am obliged to show myself responded delorme a thinlipped hawkeyed man who looked the villain he was what are two thousand francs a year my cigars cost me almost as much as that and as for sophies fortunewell a woman like that was dear at any price if i had not got it ravenel would and i should not think that you would be particularly proud of him as a grandsoninlaw i am not responded old madame bernard weakly and then summoning something of dignity added but i venture to say that he is a better man than you are count delorme at least he has been far more considerate of the feelings of sophies family and has kept himself and her in the strictest seclusion nor have they asked me for a franc i think also that the ravenels still have many friends while i am not aware of a single one that you have count delorme in answer to this delorme coolly picked up the notes and money and without counting either stuffed them in his pocket madame bernard made a faint protest there is much more there she cried than two thousand francs i did not mean to give you all but delorme rising and taking his hat walked out of the room and let himself out of the house by a small side door toni knew then what his friends were up to the three followed delorme through the park toni lagging behind presently in a dark place overhung by a clump of cedars they came upon delorme who had every vice except that of cowardice he turned on them and said in a threatening voice what do you mean by following me fellows for answer pierre and nicolas fell upon him nicolas striking him a violent blow on the head with a short loaded cudgel delorme fell over without a word and in a minute his pockets were rifled toni stood by dazed and unable to move it was all over in less than two minutes and the three were running away as fast as they could toni knew that delorme was dead lying in the roadway in the dark his face turned upward toward the night sky himself robbed of the money of which he had robbed madame bernard next morning by daylight the whole region was aroused count delorme had been found dead robbed and murdered in the park of the chateau bernard the police appeared in swarms no one had seen him at the chateau and old madame bernard had fainted when told of the murdered man being found in the park and had taken to her bed very ill so she could not be disturbed delormes identity was easily established and it was surmised that he was on his way to the chateau when he had met his fate toni listened with a blanched face to all the excited talk and colloquy that went on among the villagers as well as the circus people about the strange murder suspicion at once fell on the circus people but pierre and nicolas were old hands at the business and knew how to manage such little affairs they had promptly proceeded the first thing next morning to try for an advance of money from the manager of the circus and being refused they had tried to borrow money from several of their fellow employees to disguise the fact that their pockets were welllined at that very moment with delormes money toni had never thought of this subterfuge and did not attempt to borrow a franc he spent the day in one long spasm of terror and in the evening when the performance was over and he was going back to his lodging his two friends joined him toni said nicolas with a laughing devil in his eye as he spoke you must be very careful for suspicion might fall on you for the part you took in our little escapade you struck the blow you know toni stopped stared and threw his arms up above his head in a wild passion of despair i did noti did noti did not he cried then nicolas slipping his hand in tonis pocket drew out a twentyfranc gold piece a coin which toni had seldom in his life owned this was what you took out of the mans pocket said pierre it was too much for toni they were walking along the highway toward the village in the soft may evening toni quite unsteady on his legs sat down by the roadside he was so stunned and dazed that he could neither move nor think nor speak pierre and nicolas walked off laughing pierre meanwhile having put the twentyfranc piece in tonis pocket when toni felt this he threw the money after them frantically and it fell in the road behind them but they did not see it toni without knowing this at the time thereby accomplished a stroke of justice to these wretches illustration this is what you took out of the mans pocket he sat there a long time after his two friends had left him presently the power of thought returned to him and he said to himself toni here is another terrible secret for you to carryheavier than any yet that you have carriedtoo heavy for you to carry alone toni you are a coward if you were not you would have got away from nicolas and pierre a long time ago now see what they have led you into toni you must go to paul verney and make a clean breast of it otherwise you will live to be guillotined he had no friend to whom he could go for counsel unless he could find paul verney he took jacques out of his pocket and jacques looked at him in a friendly way and agreed with him as he always did saying toni unless you take some steps you will certainly be guillotined or sent to prison for life so make up your mind to find paul verney and tell him all about it toni took this resolution but the courage which inspired him to make it did not inspire him at once to carry it into effect he meant to do it the first thing next day but when the next morning came he put it off until the afternoon and when the afternoon came he again delayed a secret like that is frightful to keep and more frightful to tell and then suddenly their week was up at beaupre after leaving beaupre they gave performances in the small towns round about interest in the murder of delorme had by no means died out but rather increased as time passed on and no clue to the murderer was discovered toni had an instinctive feeling that the police were watching the circus people he felt that every one of them was under suspicion but he had no tangible proof of this it made him long however to get away from the circus he knew that he was of an age when his army service might begin at any moment as his twentieth birthday was close at hand he had in fact already been served with notice he could have got off being the only son of a widowed mother but it had occurred to him that by serving his time in the army he might get rid for a while of his two friends nicolas and pierre a dream came to him that after his service he would get a place as teacher in a ridingschool then he would still have horses for his friends and companions but there would be nothing of nicolas and pierre in his life the dream grew brighter the more he dwelt on it he would go back to bienville and ask his mothers pardon which he had done in every letter that he had written her and then she would forgive him and he would make her ask for the hand of denise for his wife oh how happy he could be if only he had not this terrible secret about count delorme to carry which stayed with him day and night if he could get away from the circus he thought this secret might then be less terrible to bear the first step toward this was soon accomplished by the strong arm of the law because toni found himself one june morning drawn in the conscription he had no thought of getting off because he was his mothers only son and presently he found to his immense joy that he was to be one of the number of recruits who were to report at the cavalry depot at beaupre beaupre was like bienville in one way having a small garrison and being a cavalry depot but it was new and modern unlike bienville although quite as bright the barracks and stables were all new and shining with fresh paint and oh what joy was tonis when he recalled that paul verney was stationed there it seemed to him as if what is called the good god who had neglected and forgotten him for seven whole years had at last relented and was directing his destiny and showing him the path to peace it was almost two months after tonis little adventure in the park of the chateau bernard that one morning sergeant duval the father of denise heaved a heavy sigh as he paced the tanbark in the ridingschool at beaupre and mournfully surveyed the group of recruits who were to take their first lesson in  voltige  or circus riding there were about fifty of them they all came from paris and recruits from paris are notoriously hard to break in they feel a profound contempt for the rurals a term which they apply to everybody outside of paris the sergeant running his eye over them had no difficulty in sorting them out so to speak according to their different degrees of incapacity about half were clerks waiters and artisans apprentices townbred and certain never to get over their fear and respect for horses the other half were porters and laborers and the like who could be taught to stick on a horses back but would never acquire any style in riding among them was a stupidlooking young fellow rather short but wellmade with very black eyes and a closelycropped black poll whom sergeant duval did not recognize in the least as his old friend toni the unknown aspirant for the hand of denise tonis apparent fear and dread in the company of the horses had kept the troopers in a roar of laughter ever since he had joined his awkwardness in the simple riding lesson of the day before showed what a hand he would make of it in the more difficult  voltige  and his companions had hustled him to the first place in the line so they could see the fun just then sublieutenant verney walked into the ridinghall he was the same paul verney only he was twentytwo years old and was known and loved by every man and by every horse in the regiment this triumph was something to be laid at the feet of lucie bernard whom he had loved ever since that august afternoon in the park at bienville when she had taken his book away from him and his heart went with the book sublieutenant verney was always present at the ridingdrill whether it was his turn or not and he dreamed dreams in which he saw himself as another murat or kellerman leading vast masses of heavy cavalry to overwhelm infantryfor he held to the french idea that men on horses can ride over men on foot his dog powder a smart little fox terrier was at his heels now paul verney was an especial favorite with sergeant duval who had known him as boy and man who had seen sublieutenants come and go and knew the breed well he looked gloomily at paul as he came up and ran his eye casually over the recruits pretty bad lot eh sergeant said paul dreadful sir it would have broken your heart to have seen them in the ridingschool yesterday not one of them has any more notion of riding than a bale of hay has ah well you can lick them into shape if anybody can was pauls reply to this pessimistic remark the speciallytrained horse on which greenhorns learned was then brought in he was an intelligent old charger and when he stood stockstill with a trooper holding up his forefoot his small bright eye traveled over the recruits then suddenly dropping his head he gave forth a long low whinny of disgust which was almost human in its significance old caporal even laughs at them cried the sergeant now come here you bandylegged son of a sailor and get on that horses back and do it with a single spring this was addressed to toni who lurched forward so clumsily that it was seen there was little hope for him the waiting greenhorns watched with a sympathetic grin tonis timid and awkward preparations to spring on caporals back he moved back at least ten yards and lunging forward with the energy of despair succeeded in landing on the horses crupper from which he slid to the ground and lay groaning as he rubbed his shins a shout of laughter in which every man joined except the sergeant followed this even powder gave two short sharp yaps of amusement the sergeant though was in no laughing mood now then he cried are you going to keep us here all day get up and try againand this time be sure and land between the horses ears thus adjured toni still rubbing his shins got up and going still farther off made another clumsy rush this time by scrambling with both hands and feet he managed to get on caporals back and then working forward he perched himself almost astride the horses neck and said with a foolish smile i cant get any farther forward sir get off roared the sergeant toni worked backward as he had worked forward and slid down behind old caporal at this made a disdainful motion with his hind leg and toni with a scream bolted off yelling take care take care hes beginning to kick the recruits had something else to think of now in their own efforts to vault on caporals back some of them were awkward enough but all did better than toni then came the mounting and dismounting while the horse was galloping round in a circle the sergeant standing in the middle with a long whip to keep him going toni meanwhile had stood with his heart in his mouth watching paul verney there was not on pauls part the slightest recognition of his old friend tonis shock of black hair which was as much a part of him as his black eyes and jacques in his pocket had been closelycropped and he had grown a black mustache which quite changed the character of his face and he looked away from paul verney not wishing for recognition at that time and place toni was also the first man to attempt the mounting and dismounting he ran around the circle twice before he seemed to screw up enough courage to try to mount and could not then until the sergeants long whip had tickled his legs sharply in vain he clutched at the horses mane and made ineffectual struggles once he fell under caporals feet and only by the horses intelligence escaped being trodden on if the horse were as great a fool as you areroared the sergeant crack went the sergeants whip as toni got on his legs timidity and stupidity have to be got out of any man who has to serve in a dragoon regiment and the sergeant proceeded to take them out of toni look here my man he said you have got to learn to do that trick now and heredo you understand but sergeant moaned toni i am afraid of the horse i swear i am the sergeants reply to this was to run toward toni with uplifted whip old caporal supposing the whip was meant for him suddenly broke into a furious gallop toni darted toward him lighted like a bird with both feet on the horses back folded his arms stuck his right leg out as caporal sped around the circle changed to his left turned a somersault stood on his head on the horses back for a whole minute and then with a houpla flung himself backward to the ground and approaching the sergeant stood calmly at attention the roof of the ridinghall echoed with thunders of laughter and applause sublieutenant verney leading off capering in his delight and pinching powder to make him join his yelping to the uproar the sergeant stood grinning with satisfaction he was one of the few sergeants who wanted a man to ride well and cared very little what share of praise or blame accrued to himself in the doing of it so you were in the circus he asked yes sergeantever since i was thirteen answered toni who had thrown off his stupid expression like a mask and stood up alert cool with a glint of a smile in his eye then he stopped he had not forgotten those magnanimous offers made by the sergeant to his mother to marry her for the purpose of thrashing him his old cowardice returned to him and he trembled at the idea of the coming recognition by the sergeant he certainly would not consider a circus rider a match for denise who by this time must be a young lady the seven years which had changed toni and paul from boys into men had apparently passed over the sergeant without leaving the smallest sign on him but they had marked toni so that sergeant duval so far had no idea that he was the toni whom he had yearned to thrash a light had been breaking upon paul verneys mind there had been something strangely familiar in the awkward recruit a thrill of remembrance swept over paul verney but bienville and toni were far from his mind then and besides toni as a dirty shockheaded boy had been the personification of boyish grace while this fellow had been the embodiment of awkwardness in walking as well as riding but now things began to grow clearer as for toni the old joy and love of paul came over him with a rush he straightened himself up stood at attention and turned his gaze full on the young lieutenant paul came up close to him isnt thisisnt this toni he asked for answer toni saluted and said yes sir he had learned enough during his short enlistment to say that and then surreptitiously opening his hand paul caught a glimpse of the old battered jacques in tonis palm he covered it up quickly again paul verney could not trust himself with all the recruits standing by and the riding lesson in progress to say more than come to my quarters at twelve oclockand turned away sergeant duval then recognized toni and with severe disapproval so you have turned up at last he said sternly while your poor mother has been breaking her heart in bienville these seven years about you well i will talk with you later i dont suppose you learned any good in the circus except how to ride but this could not crush toni he had felt all his perplexities and miseries dwindle since he had spoken to paul verney paul always had such a sensible level head and knew well that plain straight path out of difficultiestelling the truth and standing by the consequences at paul verneys quarters therefore on the stroke of twelve toni presented himself he had laid aside his pretended awkwardness and when he stood erect and at attention in his dragoon uniform he was a model of lithe and manly grace his circus training had developed his naturally good figure and he was as well built a young fellow as one would wish to see he was handsome too in his own odd picturesque way his teeth were as white as ever and shone now in a happy grin while his black eyes were full of the mingled archness and softness that had distinguished the dirty little toni of ten years before paul was as happy as toni and the two eyed each other with delight when they were alone paul stepped softly to the door and locking it held out his arms to toni and the two hugged each other as if they were ten years old instead of being twenty and twentytwo and now toni said paul tell me all that you have been doing i dont suppose you learned anything good in the circus except riding thats just what sergeant duval said to me replied toni and then the memory of all he had suffered since his association with pierre and nicolas came to his mind and his expressive eyes glowed it is true pai mean lieutenant that i got into bad company when i was in the circus and i want to tell you all about it but first tell me something about bienville i have written regularly to my mother but i was afraid to give her my address afraid of what asked paul tonis eyes wandered around the room aimlessly and came back to pauls i always was afraid he said your mother is alive and well said paul but heartbroken about you what induced you toni to run away as you did becausebecause that one franc still loomed large in tonis mind i took a franc from my motheronly a single franc to go to the circus and clery the tailor caught me and accused me of taking the money and whipped me and said he would have me arrested and thenoh i was so frightened i have been frightened every time i thought of that franc in these more than seven years some story of the sort got out answered paul but your mother always denied it i dont really think she missed the franc that you took out of the box but toni what a fool you werewhat a monumental fool you were toni shook his head and a coward too sir he said it was very difficult to add that sir when he spoke to paul and equally strange for paul to hear look here toni dont call me sir when we are alonei cant stand it as soon as we step outside in the corridor it shall be my man and sir but when the door is locked we are paul and toni toni nodded delightedly it never would have worked he said when the door is locked on us i never could understand that cowardice in you said paul you were the most timid boy i ever saw in my life about some things and the most insensible to fear about others i know it but the reason why you cant understand it is because you are not afraid of anything i am not afraid of horses nor of railroad wrecksi have been in one or two and was not frightenednor fires nornor any of those things which come on a man unawares and where he has just to stand still keep cool and do what he is told to do but when it comes to other things like going against another mans willoh pauli am the biggest coward alive and i know it i would never volunteer for the forlorn hope but if there was an officer by the side of me with a pistol id march to the mouth of hell because i would be more afraid of the officer than i would be of hell thats the sort of courage i have and toni grinned shamelessly but before i tell you all of the evil things that have befallen me tell me some more about bienville how does my mother look about twentyfive years older since you left and toni you must write to her this very daydo you understand metoday and i shall write to her that she may get our letters together i will answered toni and how about little denise as toni said this he blushed under his sunburned skin and paul laughed they were both very young men and their thoughts naturally turned in the same direction denise is here with her father mademoiselle duval has sold out the bakery shop so i suppose you will no longer be in love with denise toni giggled like a schoolgirl to tell you the truth he said i never have thought about any girl except denise but i can only think of her now as a little creature in a checked apron with her flaxen plait hanging down her back she is an extremely pretty young lady and a great belle with the young corporals mademoiselle duval has given her a nice little dot of ten thousand francs to her fortune but for that reason the sergeant who is a levelheaded old fellow is looking around very carefully before he disposes of denises hand toni struck his forehead with his open palm oh he cried denise is not for me i am only a private soldieri never will be anything else you can be something else if you choose said paul verney and i have been in the circus the sergeant will never forgive me that paul shook his head dolefully it was pretty bad and the sergeant was a great stickler for correctness of behavior but paul being a lover himself and a poor man who sincerely loved a rich girl sympathized with toni oh well he said we must wait and see one thing is certainif mademoiselle denise takes a notion into her head to like you the sergeant will give in for he is a very doting father but toni you must behave yourself after this indeed i will replied toni when i tell you what i have got by bad association you will understand that i mean what i say and then toni seating himself at pauls command poured out the story of all that he had suffered at the hands of nicolas and pierre ending up with that last dreadful account of the murder of delorme and that secret paul i am carrying cried poor toni putting his fists to his eyes into which the tears started and sometimes its near to killing me paul listened closely he realized quite as fully as toni did the position in which toni had got himself and did not make light of it at all events he said i dont think any one regretted delormes death he was the worst sort of a rascala gentleman rascal you know he was the first husband of madame ravenel at bienville toni nodded i have seen many women in the seven years that i have been traveling about the world said toni but i never saw one who seemed to radiate modesty and goodness as madame ravenel do the ravenels still live at bienville yes the color came into pauls face which was pink already they live there as quietly as ever but much respected they are no longer avoided but still live very quietly toni looking into pauls eyes saw his face grow redder and redder and his mouth come wide open as toni said with a sidelong glance and his oldtime grin and mademoiselle lucie beautiful as a dream replied paul with a lovers fondness for superlatives and charming beyond words only here his countenance fell she has a great fortune from america and why should she look at a sublieutenant in a dragoon regiment with two thousand francs a year and his pay if i recollect mademoiselle lucie aright answered toni and she takes a notion into her head to like you her grandmother will give in because you used to tell me in the old days when we sat in the little cranny on the bridge that mademoiselle lucie said her grandmother allowed her to do exactly as she pleased paul laughed at having his own words turned against him oh toni he cried we are a couple of poor devils who love above our stations both of us not you replied toni with perfect sincerity the greatest lady that ever lived might be proud and glad to marry you and as this was said by a person who had known paul ever since he could walk in an intimacy closer than that of a brother it meant something i have seen mademoiselle lucie continued toni i saw her one morning about two months ago when you and she were riding together she rides beautifullyi could not teach her anything in that line she does a great many things beautifully and she is the most generous warmhearted creature in the world and just the sort of a young lady to fall in love with a poor sublieutenant and throw herself and her money into his arms but if the poor lieutenant had the feelings of a gentleman he could not accept such a sacrifice he would run away to escape it paul grew quite gloomy as he said this and stroked his blond mustache thoughtfully but it is not natural at twentytwo with youth and health and a good conscience and abounding spirits to despair it was all very difficult but paul did not on that account cease loving lucie and does she still go to bienville every year to visit madame ravenel asked toni yes every year except two years that she spent in america she is just home now and veryveryamerican paul shook his head mournfully as he said this he had all the prim french ideas and the dash of american in lucie frightened him brave as he was but on her last visit to bienville before she went to america her grandmother sent with her a carriage and a retinue of horses and servants which quite dazzled bienville i think mademoiselle lucie bullies her grandmother shamefully and whom do you think she pays most attention to of all the people in bienville illustration lucie toni reflected a moment monsieur and madame verney pauls light blue eyes sparkled thats just it she has my mother with her all the time and as for my father he adores her and lucie actually pinches his arms and pulls his whiskers when she wants to be impertinent to him you know she takes advantage of being half american to do the most unconventional things and my father quite adores heralmost as much so as his son it looks to me remarked toni as if mademoiselle lucie were taking things in her own hands and meant to marry you whether you will or not i have often heard that heiresses run great risks of being married for their money and then finding their husbands very unkind perhaps mademoiselle lucie knows this and wants to marry a man like yourself who loves her for herself i think mademoiselle lucie has too much sense to marry me answered poor paul quite honestly i think it is simply her kindness and generosity that make her kind to me and affectionate to my father and mother she will marry some great mana count or a duke perhapsthere are still a few left in franceand not throw herself away on a sublieutenant of dragoons and paul sighed deeply the pair spent nearly two hours together it seemed to toni as if he could never be satiated with looking at his old friend as pink and white and blond as ever paul felt the same toward toni and when in the old way toni took jacques out of his pocket and showed him it was as if seven years passed away into mist and they were boys together but at last paul was obliged to dismiss toni who went back to his quarters with a heart lighter than it had been for seven years and he was to see more of paul than he had dared to hope for paul had promised to arrange that toni should be his soldier servant the present incumbent was not exactly to pauls liking and he was only too glad to replace him with toni there was work waiting for him and that too under sergeant duvals eye and toni did it with the energy of a man who is determined on pleasing the father of his beloved no one would have recognized in this smart active natty trooper the dirty idle toni of his boyhood sergeant duval however was a skeptic by nature and he waited to see more of toni before reversing the notion he had formed of that young man he had heard something on his annual visits to bienville of tonis fondness for denise and when she was in short frocks and pinafores had sometimes joked her about it but denise who blushed at the least little thing would hide her head on her fathers shoulder and almost weep at the idea that she had even glanced at a boy toni was longing to ask after denise but he dared not as soon as he had a moments time to himselfand a recruit lately joined has not much leisurehe wrote a long letter to his mother he did not write very well and was a reckless speller but that letter carried untold happiness and relief with it to the widow marcel at bienville his duties as pauls servant began at once toni was not overindustrious but if he had to work for any one he would wish to work for paul and then came a radiant time with tonia time when life seemed to him all fair he managed to put that secret horror of nicolas and pierre out of his mind as they were out of his sight he got his mothers forgiveness by return of post and he laid aside all the fear he had had of nicolas and pierre and enjoyed the sight and the occasional society of the two beings who with his mother were nearest to him of the worldpaul verney and denise he dared not mention denises name to sergeant duval who preserved the most unfeeling reticence about her toward toni the sergeant had no mind to encourage the attentions of young recruits just out of the circus to his pretty daughter with her splendid dot of ten thousand francs toni however knew that the time of his service would come to an end in a year and then he would be able to carry out that beautiful scheme that had haunted him during his circus life he would become an instructor in a ridingschool and earn big wages as much as two hundred and fifty francs the month and meanwhile he would lead so correct a life that even sergeant duval would be forced to approve of him all these resolutions were very much increased by the first sight he caught of denise it was about a fortnight after he joined and during that time he had kept his eyes open for the lady of his love although sergeant duval had quarters at the barracks denise and mademoiselle duval lived in lodgings in the town and toni did not have many opportunities of going into the town one sunday evening however a beautiful august sunday toni found himself standing in the public square where the band played merrily and one of those open air balls which are so french and so charming was going on ranged on benches around were the older women and among them toni at once recognized the tall angular black figure of mademoiselle duval and whirling around in the arms of a handsome dragoon with a beautiful pair of black mustaches much finer than tonis was denise tonis heart jumped into his mouth his soul leaped into his eyes it was denise of the acacia tree and the buns of long ago she was as blond as modest as neat as ever but far prettier her fair hair was twisted up on her shapely head on which sat a coquettish white hat she wore a white muslin gown with the short full skirt much beruffled denise would have liked a train but mademoiselle duval frowned sternly on such unbecoming frivolities as trained gowns for a sergeants daughter denise had developed into as much of a coquette as lucie bernard had been only in a different direction lucie achieved her conquests by a charming boldness a bewitching unconventionality denise duval succeeded in attracting the attention of the other sex by a demureness and quaint propriety which were immensely effective in their way toni having some instinctive knowledge of this determined to proceed with great caution and military prudence he would strive to carry the fortress of denises affections by gradual approaches and not by assault so in pursuance of this plan he walked up to mademoiselle duval and making a low bow said mademoiselle duval may i recall myself to your memory i am toni marcel the son of madame marcel of bienville and had the honor of knowing you when i was a boy mademoiselle duval gave him one grim look and then cried out oh i know you very well toni you were the worst boy in bienville and as dirty as you were bad oh how much trouble did you give your mother this was not a very auspicious beginning for a young man who wished to become the nephewinlaw of the lady he addressed but toni was not deficient in the sort of courage which could take him through an emergency like that he only said hypocritically and with another bow and a sigh of penitence ah mademoiselle every word that you say is true i know i was very naughty and very idle and my mother was far too patient with me i gave her a great deal of trouble but i hope to be a comfort to her in the future i had a letter from her only yesterday in which like the rest of your sex mademoiselle she showed a beautiful spirit of forgiveness i hope that she will come to visit me for a few days before long mademoiselle duval was not greatly softened by this speech but seeing toni disposed to take a scolding meekly she invited him to sit down by her side when she harangued him on all his iniquities for the last seven years the sergeant had told her that toni had been in the circus and that was enough mademoiselle duval warned toni that all circus people were foredoomed to hellfire and that he would probably lead the procession toni took the attack on himself very meekly but said i assure you mademoiselle there were some good people in the circussome good women even good women did you say screamed mademoiselle duval wearing tights and spangles and turning somersaults toni bethought him of the time when there was an outbreak of scarlet fever in the circus company and how these same painted ladies in tights and spangles stood by one another and nursed each other and each others children day and night and uttered no word of complaint or reproach he knew more than mademoiselle duval on the subject of the goodness and the wickedness which dwell in the hearts of men he told mademoiselle duval however the story of the outbreak of scarlet fever he had a natural eloquence which stood him in good stead and mademoiselle duval who was one of the best women in the world and had a soft heart although a sharp tongue was almost brought to tears by tonis story just then denises cavalier brought her back to her aunt and toni jumping up profoundly saluted denise his soul rushed into his eyes those handsome daredevil black eyes which the prim and proper denise had secretly admired from her babyhood she glanced back at him as she courtesied to him with great propriety and something in her face made tonis pulses bound with joy there was a softness almost a tenderness in her look which toni having some knowledge of the world interpreted to his own advantage denises own heart was palpitating not tumultuously like tonis but with a gentle quickness which was new to her illustration there was a softness almost a tenderness in her look ah mademoiselle said toni calling denise mademoiselle for the first time how well i remember you in my happy days at bienville when you used to give me buns under the acacia tree he stopped a soft blush came into denises fair cheeks she smiled and looked at him and then away from him denise remembered the bench under the acacia tree and all that had happened there well enough denise knew then and knew now that when the toni of those days gave up something to eat to a small girl his feelings were very deeply engaged to her she recollected in particular the first afternoon the ravenels took tea with the verneys that toni had selected one beautiful ripe plum and after eying it longingly had put his arm around her neck and put the plum in her mouth and what he had said then her blushing now revealed it all to toni suddenly the band struck up a waltz toni politely asked denise to favor him with her hand for the dance and they went off together the moon smiled softly at them and even the electric lights had a kind of tenderness in their glare when toni clasping denise in his arms for the first time began to whirl around with her to the rhythm of the music he felt himself raised above the earthall his fears all his evildoing had departed from himhe felt poor toni as if he would never be afraid of nicolas and pierre again and as if that waltz was a foretaste of heaven for him and denise too was happy he saw it in her shy eyes in the softness of her smile and presently toni drew her closer to him and whispered denise denise do you remember and denise whispered back yes toni i remember all and so as it was with paul verney and lucie bernard they called each other by their first names when they were alone presently in the mazes of the dance toni looked up and there was paul verney passing through the square he caught tonis eye and toni grinned back at him rapturously when the music stopped toni putting denises hand within his arm escorted her back to the bench where mademoiselle duval sat knitting in the electric light he contrived to pass directly in front of paul verney whom he saluted respectfully and paul bowed low to denise and said to her mademoiselle we are both natives of bienville and i am most happy to see you here with your worthy aunt and your respected father and then paul with an eye single to tonis interests walked on the other side of denise up to where mademoiselle duval sat and promptly claimed acquaintance with her in the old days at bienville there had not been such a tremendous difference between paul verney the poor advocates son and the children of the pastry shop and the confectioner now paul was an officer but he was very pleasant and gentlemanlike however though quite dignified and gave himself no haughty airs he inquired with the deepest solicitude after mademoiselle duvals health remembered gratefully sundry tarts and cakes she had given him in the old days and then said to her in the most unblushing manner and mademoiselle we have here another citizen of bienville marcelit was the first time that paul had ever called toni marcel in his lifewho i assure you is worthy of our old town he is strictly attentive to his duties and the best rider in my troop i predict that he will be a corporal before his enlistment is out and thus having advanced tonis cause with his prospective auntinlaw paul verney withdrew winking surreptitiously at toni as he went off it was impossible that mademoiselle duval should not revise her opinion of toni after this testimony from his officer so toni at once found himself in a most acceptable position with mademoiselle duval he danced twice more with denise carrying her off in the face of a couple of corporals and by his devoted attentions and insidious flattery of mademoiselle duval gained that ladys goodwill he would have liked to escort his old friends back to their lodging but as he explained he barely had time to reach the barracks before the tap of the drum and he scurried off the happiest trooper in beaupre that night when he neared the quadrangle on which the barracks faced he overtook paul verney and as he rushed past he whispered in his ear thank you thank you dear paul in that moment he could have not refrained to save his life from calling his lieutenant paul it was a bond of sympathy between paul and toni that each should as it were love above his station paul was a frequent visitor at the chateau bernard and was regarded by the stately and imposing madame bernard with very mixed feelings the old lady looked on lucie very much as a hen does which has hatched out a duckling among her brood madame bernard was a representative of the strictness of manners such as had prevailed in france fifty years before although dragonlike in her manner madame bernard was at heart a grandmother and that tells the tale lucie was her idol and the two years the young girl had spent with her mothers family in america had been one long nightmare to madame bernard when she returned she was the same lucie with an added dash of americanism which frightened madame bernard almost out of her wits nevertheless there was something about this wild young creature this half american something which gave madame bernard instinctive confidence that she could never commit the fearful error of sophie ravenel madame bernard was now more than seventy years of age and quite unequal to opposing lucies will and lucie at twenty years of age reigned over the chateau bernard in a manner that terrified and enchanted all under her sway she had somewhere in her beautiful head a nugget of american common sensea thing which none of those around her quite understood only they saw that mademoiselle lucie never came to grief in any of her pranks and schemes she was of course surrounded by admirers madame bernard had been considering offers of marriage for her ever since her eighteenth year and had nearly arranged one or two for her of the most advantageous description but what should this madcap lucie do but laugh at every one of these desirable lovers declaring that she did not mean to marry until she was quite ready and might not marry at all this latter grotesque idea mortified madame bernard who had already promised no less than six ambitious mamas that in a year or two she was sure that lucie would come to her senses then lucie was given to joking a practice which madame bernard had never heard of any girl indulging and actually made fun of the excellent  partis  which madame bernard offered for her consideration drew caricatures of them wrote nonsense verses about them and otherwise amused herself at their expense madame bernard observed that the sandyhaired young sublieutenant paul verney cool calm and matteroffact seemed to have a singular influence and that for good over lucie their meeting had come about in the most natural way possible on lucies return from america she had gone to bienville to pay madame ravenel that longed for visit her coming upset the whole town and was of itself a cyclone with the rash generosity of youth lucie who now understood sophies sad history took on herself the task of placing the ravenels upon the footing which she thought they deserved this meant bringing as she had promised to do in her childish days long ago a retinue of horses and carriages and servants with her likewise of dazzling gowns and ravishing hats and making her visit one long fete the ravenels wiser than little lucie tried to curb her but as well try to curb a wandering zephyr as lucie bernard with a noble and generous impulse in her heart the people of bienville were a kindly set on whom the selfrespecting seclusion of the ravenels had not been without its impress when ambitious mamas and impressionable young officers found that the only way to make any terms with this child of brilliant destiny was to accept those she loved at the value she placed on them it was not so difficult to accomplish the ravenels in that fortnight of lucies visit got more invitations than they had received in all the years they had lived in bienville among the first was to drink tea in the verneys gardena modest form of entertainment suited to the advocates means it happened to be madame verneys feteday a day which paul always spent with his mother if possible madame verney had not only written but telegraphed for paul to get leave if he possibly could it was a long distance to travel to spend twentyfour hours with his mother and pauls two thousand francs allowance besides his pay had a habit of walking off mysteriously just like the allowances of other young officers but one line at the end of madame verneys letter settled the matter for sublieutenant paul verney the line ran thusmademoiselle lucie bernard will be staying with the ravenelsher first visit since her return from americaand the ravenels are coming to tea with us on my feteday paul went that moment and asked boldly for a weeks leave he got to bienville at noon on the great day and at five oclock when the little festivity was inaugurated in the garden and the ravenels entered there was paul still pink and white and sandyhaired not spoiled with beauty but adorned with manliness with the new affectation of the young french officers he adopted the modern fashion of discarding his uniform on every possible occasion and wearing citizens clothes whenever he could but on this day he could not but remember what lucie had said a long time ago about his wearing a uniform next time they should meet so he put on his handsome new undress uniform and looked a soldier his mother admired him immensely so did his father and so in fact did lucie when that young lady in a dazzling white costume and charming white hat and white shoes came tripping along the garden path paul blushed from his head to his heels as he made her a beautiful bow but lucie who had acquired the startling american fashion of shaking hands with any and everybody deliberately slipped her little hand in his and gave him a look from under her long eyelashes which said as plainly as wordswelcome paul and by madame verneys teatable in the little garden their hearts were cemented without one word being spoken between them after that paul was with lucie every moment he could contrive while he was in bienville cursing himself meanwhile for being a villain in forcing his company on that radiant creature with her millions of francs he had however the best excuse in the worldhe could not help it and when he found that he would shortly be sent to beaupre in the immediate neighborhood of the chateau bernard he was the happiest and likewise the most miserable creature alive lucie was unblushingly happy and demanded that as soon as he arrived at beaupre he should present himself at the chateau and pay his respects to madame bernard of course he did it wicked as he knew it to be with the result that he was the only man whom lucie really encouraged and in a little while as natures quickly adjust themselves to each other paul acquired a species of control over lucie a thing which no one but sophie ravenel had ever done before she generally wished to do what was right but on the occasions when she wished to do what was wrong madame bernard saw that the sandyhaired young sublieutenant could turn lucie from her way in particular he could dissuade her from doing many rash things sometimes innocent sometimes dangerous she was an accomplished though reckless rider and when she would have ridden a horse which rightly named comet had run away once and might be depended on to do so again paul verney had managed to do more with her by a few words than all of madame bernards prayers and the exhortations of the head groom paul often came over to the chateau bernard and on one special afternoon he found comet saddled and waiting and when he went into the drawingroom madame bernard implored him to try to persuade lucie not to ride comet presently lucie tripped in looking charming in her ridinghabit and with the light of contradiction in her eyes paul she knew objected to her riding the horse and she was prepared to defy him i think mademoiselle said paul quietly it would scarcely be judicious for you to ride comet lucie who was proud of her horsemanship resented this promptly and replied but i wish to ride comet i am perfectly capable of managing him and besides he is not really vicious the last may be true mademoiselle but i think you are mistaken in the former you have no more real control over comet than a butterfly has for answer lucie tapped her whip smartly on the mantelpiece and said thank you very much monsieur verneyi must beg you to excuse megood afternoon and was going out of the room when paul who had walked over from his quarters asked of madame bernard madame may i have one of your horses saddled and follow mademoiselle lucie on her dangerous ride indeed you may replied poor madame bernard wringing her hands take anything you may find in the stables lucie burst out laughing and do you mean to ride in that dress she asked of paul who had on a frock coat and held a silk hat in his hand it isnt the dress that i would choose to ride in mademoiselle answered paul laughing i dare say i shall look quite ridiculous in this costume scampering after youeverybody we meet will surmise the reasonnevertheless i shall go but you will not cried lucie running out of doors to where the horses were standing she was not equal to the impertinence of having her groom assist her on horseback with an officer and a gentleman standing by and furthermore the groom understood the situation and kept discreetly in the background paul further astounded her by directing the groom to ride to the stables and have a horse saddled for him and brought at once lucie was so angry that she had to wink her dark bright eyes to keep the tears from coming but paul was as cool and as calm as possible never mind monsieur said lucie in a trembling voice i shall ride cometof that you may be sure you may force yourself on me today but you can not do it every day and i shall ride what horse i please paul urged by his love and tenderness for her said words for which he thought he would have died rather than have spoken dear lucie if you are as reckless as that you will break my heart forgive me for calling you by your name but dont you remember seven years ago in the park at bienville you told me that when we were grown up we should call each other paul and lucie in private paul stopped he felt as if he were guilty of a crime in saying these words to that enchanting creature who would marry so far above him in every way all at once he saw a vision of his fathers modest house at bienville and thought of his own small allowance and slender pay and reckoned himself the greatest fool in existence but lucies reply to this was to look at him with a mysterious smile on her expressive face and to say softly this is the first time that you have ever called me by name paul they were standing on the lawn in full view of dozens of eyes while this was passing paul looked at her in dumb admiration and despair but there was nothing in the least despairing in the smile which presently rippled over lucies face with her eyes all fire and dew the fact is that mademoiselle lucie had been very much in love with sublieutenant paul verney ever since they had been children together in the park at bienville and wished him to know it and she was in love with the best part of himhis courage his modesty his good sense his clean and upright life and having the american archness in her nature she saw the humorous side of it and could not forbear laughing at poor paul but i think she said a gentleman should keep his word you promised me that you would call me by my first name in private and you have only done it once and now you speak as if you would never do it again paul secretly thought lucie just as he had always done a very improper little person but quite irresistible at all events said lucie airily flicking the blossoms of a tall blue hydrangea nodding gravely in the sun i intend to call you paul in private that isand i dont think i shall go to ride this afternoon and promise me said paul coming a little closer and looking at her earnestly that you wont ride comet any morelucie i promise then paul replied lucie with an affectation of a meekness which was far removed from her and which she only used for purposes of her own then the horses were sent away and the two walked together across the lawn and into the drawingroom where madame bernard sat in an agony i shall not ride this afternoon grandmama said lucie monsieur paul would insist on going with me and he would look so utterly ridiculous on horseback dressed as he is that i was ashamed to be seen with him so instead he will stay and have tea with us and meanwhile we shall go and play billiards this charmed madame bernard who concluded that the next time lucie was refractory she would send posthaste for sublieutenant verney to manage her it is not to be supposed that madame bernard did not see the possibilities of the future as well as madame verney had done long years before when paul and lucie had played together as children but madame bernard like many other women who know much of the world was beginning dimly to reach a just estimate of things after having seen many marriages and a considerable number of divorces she had realized that it was the man and not the title or the estate with which a woman must reckon and paul was so very attentive to madame bernard picking up her ball of worsted when she was knitting and giving her his advice when asked regarding the colors of her embroidery that she had begun to wish paul verney had at least a family tree if not a title money she was not so particular about as lucie had plenty of that but he was only a sublieutenant and his father was an advocate in a small way in a provincial town madame bernard groaned when she thought of these last things when billiards was proposed the old lady made no objection whatever but followed the two young people into the large cool billiard room with its parquet floor and ground glass ceiling and embroidered industriously while the two played a merry game and lucie beat paul two points to one she could beat him at billiards at tennis and at cards she sang and played much better than he and rode quite as well and she delighted in showing her skill over him but having a great deal of sense in her pretty head she realized that in all considerable things paul stood near the top he took his defeats so pleasantly for he was the most modest fellow alive that lucie often declared there was no pleasure in beating him this particular afternoon lucie beat him most shamefully but paul had his reward in the enjoyment of her exquisite grace in playing the most graceful game in the world madame bernard apparently absorbed in her embroidery was watching every tone and motion and saw that they were playing another game far more interesting and with much greater stakes than any game of billiards and as she had a presentiment that lucie would have her own way in the matter of a husband madame bernard with calm resignation was quite reconciled to paul and was glad in the present instance it was no worse they played through the whole afternoon and madame bernard asked paul to stay to dinner but this he was obliged to decline much to his vexation a sublieutenant of dragoons is not master of his own time so paul went away reluctantly and was followed by the vision of a charming figure showing the most beautiful hand and arm in the world and dealing the most deadly shots to her antagonist when dinner was over lucie came and sat by madame bernard in her own small drawingroom as the old lady stitched at her embroidery under the evening lamp illustration saw that they were playing another game far more interesting grandmama she said quietly after a long pause what do you think of paul verney a most estimable young man replied madame bernard his family are not at all rich or distinguished said lucie but they are very dear i wish you could see his father so kind so pleasant so gallant toward madame verney and like an older brother to paul and madame verney is sweeti love to see them together paul and his father and mother and then they are so kind to poor sophie and captain ravenel whenever sophie ravenels name was mentioned it was like a knife to madame bernards proud weak sensitive heart it was not only that sophies conduct had been sinful but what was worse it was such bad form lucie meditated a while and then added and paul is a poor man even for a sublieutenant and he will not have an easy time of it he has no family influence or powerful friends to push him forward and he will only get on by his own merits but that always tells in the long run when paul is forty all his superiors will know what a fine man and what a fine officer he is he will be given things for the asking that other men strive and struggle for and he is not at all handsome though he looks well in uniform and on horseback then a silence fell in the drawingroom there was not a sound except the ticking of the gilt clock lucie was sitting by the table her elbows upon it her rounded chin in her hands my dear said madame bernard why do you call monsieur verney by his first name because said lucie quite calmly taking madame bernards embroidery out of her hands and looking her full in the face because i love him those pleasant days of late summer and early autumn were a halcyon time to paul and lucie and to toni and denise toni was troubled with no qualms whatever with regard to denises superiority to him and the fact that she might justly aspire to something far beyond a private soldier he was the toni of old and like the great napoleon he reckoned that if he wanted a thing it was his already and instead of shrinking from the idea of denises impressive fortune of ten thousand francs he was glad she had so much and wished that it was morenot that he meant to squander it or that he loved denise for it he would have loved her just as well without a franc nor did he love her any better for having it but he did not consider that the ten thousand francs placed any barrier between denise and himself and then from the first moment their eyes had met on the night of the ball in the public square that old sweet feeling of being cared for and protected by denise had stolen into his heart toni wanted a wife to protect him from other people and from himselfthat was the long and short of it as for denise her nature had shaped itself to the idea of looking after toni and she wanted to give him all the buns and good things in life with paul and lucie this was exactly reversed lucie felt the most charming sense of protection in pauls strong arm and strong sense toni courted denise assiduously and did the same by mademoiselle duval and the sergeant and succeeded in the course of time in winning a grudging respect from the sergeant that stern warrior knew too much about tonis boyhood to accept him at his own value but his perfect knowledge of the  voltige  was an irresistible recommendation to the sergeant and moreover there was no denying that toni was a good soldier attentive to his duty he had not once been punished since he had joined and this was a remarkable record even for the best of soldiers then toni stood well with his sublieutenant this counted for something with the sergeant nevertheless he remembered how in the old days at bienville tonis black shock and paul verneys blond head were often close together and these youthful friendships have a strong hold on many men still paul verney was not the man to overlook the sins of a conscript and the sergeant was forced to admit that no fault could be found with toni so far illustration denise he had begun by suspecting tonis intentions toward denise but his suspicions had been completely lulled to sleep chiefly by denise herself this young person who rarely raised her eyes from the ground and might have posed for a statue of simplicity knew perfectly well how to throw dust in the sergeants eyes concerning toni she never allowed him to be mentioned without some disparaging remark such as that ridiculous toni or that absurd creature she called attention to the fact which everybody knew that tonis nose was a snub she also observed what nobody else had that toni slouched when he walked and was very ugly toni in truth was the most graceful fellow in the regiment and handsome in his blackeyed blackbrowed way denise would scarcely admit that toni knew how to ride but even this did not put the sergeant on his guard she openly complained that toni did not know how to dance and waltzed all over her feet when he danced with her in the evenings in the public square when in her fathers presence and toni was there denise treated him like a dog he was the only person living to whom she had ever shown any active hostility but the mild the gentle denise would take him up on the smallest provocation yawned at his jokes laughed when he told of his discomforts and contradicted most of his assertions mademoiselle duval who had become a great friend of tonis lectured denise on this and even the sergeant told her that he thought she was rather hard on poor toni at this denise shrugged her shoulders hes such a bore she said i always recollect him as a dirty greedy little boy at bienville i believe he is just the same now toni certainly showed neither of those traits at present but denise would not allow a word to be said in his favor toni however strange to say did not appear to be discomposed by this conduct of denises but joined the duval party two or three times a week when they sat on the pleasant evenings in the public square listening to the music and invariably asked denise to dance with him he even had the assurance when it grew cool in the autumn evenings to come to their lodgings and it was here that denises neglect of him inspired the sergeant to remonstrate with her toni had the superlative impudence even to bring an occasional bag of roasted chestnuts or some little cakes to denise for toni was a connoisseur in cakes but she invariably declared that they were very bad of their kind this same denise when she and toni danced together would whisper in his ear be sure and ask me to dance at least twice more or tripping along the street would meet him and lifting her pretty eyes to him would say toni when are you coming to see us againbut such is the nature of woman early in september madame marcel arranged to come to pay toni a visit as toni could not go to see her and toni engaged a lodging for her in the same house where mademoiselle duval and denise lodged what do you think aunt cried denise on learning this from the landlady that impudent toni has dared to engage a room for his mother on the same floor with us the sergeant happened to be present he had grateful recollections of madame marcel the neatness of her shop and the thriving trade she had as well as that ladys personal charms denise said he you gibe at toni entirely too much and as for his mother a most estimable woman is madame marcel and an old friend and neighbor and i desire that you treat her with politeness certainly i shall papa replied denise but as for that odious toni you know i cant stand him you will have to stand him replied the sergeant tartly he is a good soldier and seems to have reformed completely and you must show him some respect while his mother is here at least do you understand me denise denise understood him perfectly only the sergeant did not in the least understand denise it was on an early autumn afternoon that toni met his mother in the thirdclass waitingroom at the station when he took her in his arms he felt himself a little boy again madame marcel was not much changed except that her hair of a satin blackness like tonis when he had last seen her was now amply streaked with gray mama mama cried toni kissing her while the big tears ran down his cheeks your hair is gray and it is i who have done it no no toni cried madame marcel who was kissing him all over his face and who like most mothers was unwilling to admit that the prodigal had been at fault your mother is growing old my son that is it she was still handsome though and very well dressed in her black bonnet and silk mantle and looked quite the lady toni felt proud of her as he escorted her through the street carrying her bags and parcels on his arm and madame marcel felt proud of her handsome young soldier with his trim uniform for toni under the guidance and recommendation of his corporal had developed into a model of soldierly smartness in dress toni showed his mother up stairs into the neat room he had engaged for her and madame marcel stowed away the provisions she had brought for herself and toni being a thoughtful soul then toni sat in his mothers lap as he had done when he was a little boy and told her everything that had happened to him except about nicolas and pierre he was trying to oust those two villains from his mind and to shut the door on that terrible secret that he shared with them he told his mother about denise and mademoiselle duval and madame marcel knowing denise to be the most correct of young girls with ten thousand francs as her fortune rejoiced that toni had fallen in love with her for it was clearly impossible that denise or any other girl could resist her toni now that he was clean and was doing his duty after a while a tap came at the door and when toni opened it there stood the sergeant got up as if he were on dress parade under the eye of the general himself his mustaches beautifully waxed not only waxed but flagrantly dyed a shining black he greeted madame marcel with effusion and then said i came to request that madame marcel will have supper with us tonight she has not yet made her arrangements perhaps and my sister and my daughter will be most pleased i am sorry toni that i can not ask you but you are due at the barracks illustration the sergeant got up as if he were on dress parade it struck toni that this was a scheme for getting him out of the way he saw something in the sergeants eye which indicated a very deep interest in madame marcel and then recollection came surging over toni of the proposition which the sergeant had made some few years before to marry madame marcel for the purpose of thrashing the little boy who hid trembling under the counter toni was too big to thrash now but the sergeant always appeared to him to be about nine feet high toni did not approve of the match in the concrete but in the abstract as the sergeants advances to madame marcel might result to the advantage of toni and denise toni determined to encourage him he felt sure that his mother like most mothers was more in love with him than with any other man and would hardly dare jilt him for the finest sergeant in the french army so toni on his way to the barracks turned over things in his mind and determined to forward the sergeants suit up to a certain point things turned out very much as toni had anticipated the sergeant had reached that time of life when he began to look forward to his retirement he had saved up something and by his sisters thrift and generosity denise was provided for but the idea of madame marcels large warm cheerful kitchen in winter and shady garden in summer would be extremely attractive to a retired sergeant on halfpay and madame marcel was extremely comely there was no doubt about that and not given to scolding like mademoiselle duval as for madame marcel she saw through the sergeant in fortyeight hours and what she did not see toni enlightened her upon mama said he some days after when the two were in the privacy of madame marcels room i think sergeant duval wants to marry you for answer madame marcel blushed up to her eyes and replied for shame toni i have no idea of marrying again i didnt say you had replied the wily toni i said the sergeant wants to marry you or rather i think he wants to marry the shop but he doesnt want to marry mei am too big to thrash but mama he continued coming up to her and putting his arm around her waist a species of lovemaking which mothers adore you mustnt throw the sergeant down too hard at least not for the present because iihere toni blushed more than his mother and grinned bashfully because i want to marry denise i never told you this before there was no need to toni replied his mother laughing i have seen it ever since you were ten years old and i think denise wants to marry you at this tonis black eyes danced i think so too he said with his own inimitable naivete for all she is so bashful she has told me so a great many times with her eyes that is and it would be an excellent match for you toni replied his mother denise is so orderly so neat and such a good manager and after you have served your term and come back to bienville i will take you and denise with me into the shop i can do better than that cried toni i can be instructor in a ridingschool and get three hundred francs the month and then you can sell the shop and come and live with denise and me madame marcel was too sensible a woman to accept this arrangement beforehand but replied prudently very well if you can make three hundred francs the month you and denise can go and live in paris and i will visit you twice a year it would hardly be safe for me to give up the shop but we should be afraid to leave you there said toni roguishly chucking his mother under the chin with the sergeant just across the way for he will be retired just as my time is up you and he might elope some fine day and then come and fall down on your knees and humbly beg my pardon i certainly shall if i elope replied madame marcel smiling the sergeant is hard hit continued toni let me see you had supper with them the evening you camethat was thursday then the next morning the sergeant sent you in a melon for your breakfast and in the afternoon when you were sitting in the public square he joined you i saw him sitting on the bench beside you but he sneaked off as soon as he saw me comingthat was friday then friday evening he put denise up to asking you to take a walk and you fell in with him so denise tells me and he walked home with you and today just then a tap came at the door and the sergeant with his beautifully waxed and dyed mustaches appeared he carried in his hand a large nosegay and without seeing toni bowed low to madame marcel and said madame will you honor me by accepting this little offering madame marcel advanced smiling and accepted the nosegay shyly toni meanwhile had slipped behind a screen which concealed the stove how very charming you are looking today madame no one would dream that you had a son as old as toni you should represent him as your younger brother said the sergeant gallantly and quite unaware of toni behind the screen for all madame marcel declared she never meant to marry again nevertheless she was a woman and the sergeants compliments tickled her agreeably so she smiled coyly at this and declared she looked a hundred nonsense cried the sergeant you dont look more than twentyfive and by the way madame my sister and my daughter are making up a party for tomorrowi am off duty for the whole afternoonand we should be very much pleased if you would join us in a little excursion by the tramway to a very pleasant place about two miles from here in the country there is an inn with a garden and we can take our luncheon with us and order the wine from the inn we shall start at five oclock and we shall hope to have the pleasure of your charming company that was too much for toni he suddenly emerged from behind the screen and said grasping the sergeants hand with effusion thank you thank you sergeant so much we will accept with pleasure i think i can get off too by applying to lieutenant verney the sergeant scowled at toni here was a pretty kettle of fish he had no notion of having him with their party but there was now no help for it the prospect was charming for toni the sergeant he felt sure would devote himself to madame marcel and then toni and denise would be left to themselvesonly what was to become of mademoiselle duval toni knew the golden lion well also its garden and orchard and it was full of little sequestered places where he might have a quiet word with denise except for mademoiselle duval but toni was a strategist of no mean order and if he once got denise in the garden of the golden lion he thought he could see her for a few minutes alone so the party was made up for the next day if the weather should permit toni too could get off after parade which was at four oclock and everything seemed most auspicious except concerning mademoiselle duval as toni walked his beat that night for he was doing sentry duty he began to turn over in his mind various plans by which he could get rid of his prospective auntinlaw and suddenly a brilliant idea came to him he knew mademoiselle duval was mortally afraid of snakes it is true it was hardly the season for snakes being the middle of september but this would make no difference to mademoiselle duval who shuddered even in january at the thought of a snake toni therefore laid his plans and the next morning he contrived to get off for an hour and went to mademoiselle duvals lodgings denise was out and mademoiselle duval was reading the weekly religious newspaper which was her sole literary recreation mademoiselle said toni in a low voice so that his mother on the same floor might not hear him this afternoon i believe we are all to go for an excursion to the golden lion and have tea in the garden i want to ask you as a favor not to mention to my mother that the place is full of snakes of all sorts i have been there often and i have never gone in my life that i did not see a snake and sometimes half a dozen in that garden they are not at all dangerous but if my mother saw one it would alarm her so much and i dont wish her to know that there are any to be seen awawaw mademoiselle duval shrieked you may take your mother if you like toni but nothing on earth would induce me to go toni could have hugged her on the spot but he began to urge her pray mademoiselle dont think of remaining behind the snakes are perfectly harmless i assure you most of them are the little green garter snakes that are as harmless as the garter you wear around your leg this speech caused mademoiselle duval to blush and she said sternly toni your language and allusion are most improper at all events i am resolved not to go to the golden lion this afternoon it will annoy the sergeant very much if you dont go and if he knows that it is on account of a few little garter snakes he will laugh at you for the rest of your life particularly as it is now september and they are not very active my brother may laugh at me as much as he likes replied mademoiselle duval privately resolving not to give the sergeant the chance i simply shall not go perhaps i may make some excuse to keep my brother and denise from urging me but i shall not goof that you may be sureand i think you are a most undutiful son to take your mother to any such place as for my brother and denise they go about as if there were no such things as snakes in the world toni returned to the barracks confident of victory and was not at all surprised when at five oclock he met his mother and the sergeant and denise at the tram station to find that mademoiselle duval had a raging headache and was compelled to remain at home the sergeant too rather liked the arrangement except that he was afraid that denise would not be sufficiently polite to toni so on their way to the rendezvous he had warned her now denise he said i wont have you running away from toni and treating him like a dog before his mother this afternoon you have got to be civil to him yes papa answered denise with the air of a martyr i suppose i shall have to be civil to him before his mother but toni really bores me dreadfully oh denise what a storyteller you are when they got on the tram it was so crowded that it was impossible for the party to get seats together so denise making a pretty grimace on the sly at her father went and sat with toni quite at the end of the car and out of sight of her father and tonis mother and her first speech whispered softly in his ear was oh toni how nice it is to be together like this toni answered not one word but he looked at denise with his whole soul shining out of his lustrous black eyes and denise thought him the finest young soldier in the world it was a warm september afternoon and their road lay through the beautiful valley of the seine there were many family parties on the tram and when they reached the golden lion the large garden and even the orchard beyond were full of tables at which people were eating and drinking there were plenty of soldiers about and some of tonis comrades would have been very much pleased at an introduction to the sergeants pretty daughter but the sergeant would not oblige them neither would toni the party seated themselves at a table under an acacia tree which reminded toni and denise of that other acacia tree at bienville under which they had sat and munched and loved in their childhood madame marcel unpacked their lunch basket and they ordered wine and tea from the inn and proceeded to enjoy themselves under the combined influence of wine and woman the sergeant grew positively loverlike and when their tea was over and they got up to walk about the garden he very soon managed to have madame marcel to himself he was quite unconscious of being assisted in his manoeuvers by toni and denise and madame herself who had a very good mind to give toni all possible chances with denise and her ten thousand francs so presently toni found himself alone with denise in a little nook in the orchard behind a great clump of dwarf plum trees the soft light of evening was about them the air was hushed and the stillness was only broken by the faint and distant sounds of merriment all the world seemed fair and beautiful and peaceful and the fairest thing of all to toni was the blue heaven of denises eyes she wore a pretty blue gown and a jaunty black hat upon her blond hair her eyes which were as blue as her gown were usually downcast but were now upturned to toni quite frankly she had loved toni as long as he had loved herindeed the world without toni had seemed to her quite an impossible place he said softly to her denise in all those seven years that i did not see you did you ever think of me yes replied denise she said this with a simple sincerity that went to tonis heart you know every time i wrote to my mother i always put the most important line at the bottommy love to d she knew what i meant yes said denise with a little gasp of pleasure she always gave me your message i always felt that sometime or other we should be denise and toni as we had been when you were a dear little girl and i was a dirty bad little boy and denise i swear to you whatever i have done wrong in my life i have been true to you i never told any other girl that i loved her because i never loved any other girl i took my fling with them but in every girl i ever saw in my life it seemed to me that i saw something of you denise you need not think that women in the circus are bad just because they are in the circus there are plenty of them that are just as good in their way asas mademoiselle duval is in hers they dont take a religious newspaper but they stand by each other in their troubles they help with each others children and when a womans husband gives her a black eye all the other women fly at him and help to abuse him oh denise i think women are very good and the worst of them is too good for the best of men denise i am not half good enough for you but i want you to marry me as soon as my time is up i can get off with one years service if i escape punishments and that i have done and mean to do for your sake denise he took denises hand in histheir eyes met and then their lips a bird in the plum tree above began cooing softly to its mate the bird seemed like toni and denise to think the earth was heaven their lovemaking was very simple as were their natures and their lives they were only a private soldier and a sergeants daughter but they loved each other well and asked nothing better of life than love meanwhile things had not been progressing so favorably with sergeant duval and madame marcel the sergeant had been a little too vigorous in his wooing and madame marcel who simply had tonis advantage in view felt called on to repress her lover the sergeant who had a big voice in his big frame had made his wishes concerning his future with madame marcel quite audible to all the people surrounding them everybody had heard him say now madame you should think of changing your condition really the cares of your shop are too many for youa great deal too many i have managed them for the past twenty years replied madame marcel who thought herself better qualified to keep a candy shop than the sergeant was and who understood perfectly what the sergeant was driving at true said the sergeant floundering a little but a woman should not stand aloneshe is not able to do itthats the truth she is being taken advantage of at every turn and sometimes calmly responded madame marcel the advantage is on her side i have managed during my twenty years of widowhood to accumulate a competence toni will not be badly off when i die and when he marries i mean to make him an allowance equal to the income from his wifes dowry this seemed sinful waste to the sergeant who thought toni did not deserve such generosity that superfluity of which madame marcel spoke he considered had much better be expended on a worthy veteran who had served his country for more than thirty years and who would like extremely to end his days in affluence but it was plain that madame marcel had the best of him in the argument that a woman could not take care of herself so the sergeant changed his tactics but it would be so much more comfortable for you madame to have a protectora husband i mean toni will get married and go off and that will be the end of him the sergeant snapped his fingers but a kind and affectionate husband a man of steady habits most men of bad habits are very steady in those habits replied madame marcel she was not a satirist and her remark was the more telling because of her sincerity you are right madame but i mean a man of good habits a man who doesnt spend most of his time at the wine shops who has some domestic virtues i believe madame that the noncommissioned officers in the french army are the finest body of men in the world for domestic life i never knew a sergeant or a corporal either for that matter who was not a good husband then i couldnt go amiss if i should take any one of them answered madame marcel demurely there is a very nice man a corporal lately retired who has bought out the cigar shop near me at bienville gossip has linked our names together but i had not thought of marrying him by no means should you marry him cried the sergeant realizing that he had been too general in his commendations he is probably after your shop and after that nice little competence which i judge from your words you have accumulated no madame you could aspire to a sergeantit would be sinful to throw yourself away on a corporal madame marcel smiled mysteriously but a good many of the listeners smiled quite openly particularly a party of soldiers near them one of them behind madame marcels back undertook to enact the part of madame marcel while his comrade mimicking every action of the sergeants managed to convulse all who observed him as he followed this love scene the sergeant folded his arms twirled his dyed mustaches and reflected he had not made a single breach in the defense as yet he had heard that women were easily made jealous so he concluded to try it as a  ruse de guerre  for my part he said i have concluded at the end of my present term of enlistment to marry and settle down i may say to you madame in strict confidence that i have considered the charms of mademoiselle dumont the dressmaker whose establishment is a short way from yours madame at bienville she is a most estimable woman of a suitable age and has given me some marks of encouragementin fact i believe it was generally thought among our acquaintances at the time of my last visit to bienville that i should have proposed to mademoiselle dumont before i left my attentions i admit had been somewhat compromising i had sent her a large basket of figs and one day when i went fishing i also sent her my whole catch besides having taken her and her sister on an excursion into the country and having entertained them handsomely i thought when i saw mademoiselle dumont for the last time that she seemed a little piqued and i have reason to know that she reckons herself rather illtreated by me but it is by no means unlikely that on my return next summer i shall offer my hand to mademoiselle dumont perhaps you have not heard remarked madame marcel sweetly that mademoiselle dumont was married about two months ago to hermann the swiss violinist who taught toni to play the violin this was a facer for the sergeant but he carried it off better than could be expected so she married hermann the fiddlera swiss fiddler then she was more chagrined than i supposed i suspected she would do something rash if i went away without proposing poor poor creature as for hermanns teaching your toni to play the violin why madame toni could no more play the fiddle than he can command the regiment very well mademoiselle dumont would have been no match for a sergeant i am glad now that i did not propose to her as she certainly expected me to do she is much better matched with a swiss fiddler than with a sergeant who has seen service for more than thirty years the sergeant eyed madame marcel closely was it possible that this demure and correct person in her neat black bonnet and graceful mantle was poking fun at himsergeant duval of the dragoons but madame marcel looked so innocent that it was impossible to fathom her and just then toni and denise appeared on the scene the instant madame marcels maternal eye fell upon toni she knew that something had happened and that that something was good and presently it was time to go home and they all journeyed back to beaupre they walked to their lodgings together through the soft purple twilight of september toni went with his mother to her room and taking her in his arms poured out his heart to her his mother kissed him and shed a few tears as mothers will do under those circumstances and then toni had to run for the barracks as hard as he could about nine oclock when he was through with his stable work and was standing in the barrack square he saw paul verney passing by toni stood at attention with such a look on his face that paul verney stopped and spoke to him what do you want  mon enfant  he said after that pleasant form of address with which the officers speak to their soldiers to see you sir in private for a little while answered toni under his breath very well then come to my quarters at halfpast nine illustration was it possible that this demure and correct person  was poking fun at him so at halfpast nine toni presented himself at pauls quarters it never seemed to them to be at all strange that paul should be sitting at his ease smoking in the chair before his writingdesk while toni stood stiffly at attention the sympathy which bound them was too close for those trifling distinctions to count and between the officer sitting and the soldier standing it was still paul and toni in private paul was smoking now and on his desk under the greenshaded lamp lay a pretty little note he was composing an answer to it with as much care and precision as if it were a report to the minister of war the light of the lamp fell on his blond head and fairish complexion as paul looked at toni he could not but think how toni was improved by being made into a soldier he was certainly the best looking young fellow in pauls troop well toni said paul out with it i saw you on the tram today with denise toni turned red under his tan and sunburn his mouth came open in a delighted grin showing every one of the large white teeth he brought his straight black brows together and said in that tone of intimacy which carried the officer and the soldier back to the days when they belonged to the great democracy of boys and huddled together in the nook on the old bridge at bienville denise loves me he did not think it necessary to say how much he loved denise paul rose and putting both hands on tonis shoulders gave him a vigorous shake of affection i am deuced glad to hear it he said if you dont behave yourself to that sweet girl after you are married i promise you the handsomest drubbing you ever had in your life what do you think the sergeant will say god knows said toni dolefully shaking his head i think he wants to marry my mother or marry the shop that is you see his term is up sir next year but i dont think my mother wants to marry him or anybody else but would it be a good thing if the sergeant thought it would help his chances with your mother if he agreed to let you have denise asked paul who was usually the soul of candor but who like all men was machiavellian in love matters that it would sir answered toni very well said paul grinning sympathetically at toni i shall speak to the sergeant myself about you unluckily the sergeant knows us both too wellhe used to see us when we were boys together at bienville still you have been a good soldier toni and i dont think anything can be said against you exceptexcept here tonis eyes grew wide and bright with fear except about nicolas and pierre i hope we shall never see or hear anything more of those two rapscallions again replied paul and at all events it is not worth while to say anything about that part of your life toni you are in some respects the greatest coward i ever saw i know answered toni frankly i always was you remember i cant help it but at least i am not afraid of horses nor of guns nor of fighting if an officer will only stand by me and look at me very hard paul sat down at the desk and fingered the little note to which he was composing a reply he began to reflect how much better off toni was than himself toni was not held back from the girl of his choice by any consciousness of inequality in worldly position although a girl of denises beauty merit and fortune might certainly look higher than toni but lucie bernardwhen paul thought of her millions of francs her beauty and then saw himself a sublieutenant of dragoons the son of a middleclass advocate at bienville his heart was like lead in his breast toni said he presently do you remember how mademoiselle lucie bernard used to look in the old days at bienville perfectly cried toni dont i remember the day that she talked with you in the park when i showed you where she was and when madame ravenel fainted didnt i tell you so you could bring the water in your cap oh i remember mademoiselle lucie well she was the prettiest little lady and she is just the same now i have seen her several times since i have been here and she always smiles and nods at me so sweetly paul could not confide so frankly in toni as toni had confided in him but nevertheless they understood each other without any more words paul sat and frowned and looked at his note ah toni he said this world is full of thorns for a sublieutenant of dragoons without any fortune you may go now toni went toward the door but paused with the knob in his hand i think he whispered you will soon be as happy as i am and then he vanished through the door and went clattering down the corridor after toni had gone paul smoked and looked for a long time at the pretty little note he got one almost every day lucie wished him to come to dinner or to ride with her or to send her a book or to do something which was an excuse to get paul to the chateau bernard and it was impossible that madame bernard should not know of all this but paul remembered with a groan that lucie had always been able to wrap that imposinglooking person around her little finger and would it be rightwould it be a manly thingfor a poor sublieutenant of dragoons to take advantage of this childish fancy paul resting his blond head in both his hands remembered that sometimes these youthful attachments which begin as it were with ones first look at life last throughout the whole play until the curtain goes down at the end this puzzled him still more and he suddenly thrust lucies letter and her sweet image and toni and bienville and the whole business out of his head and taking up a book on strategy studied until midnight the note from lucie was to ask him to ride with her the next afternoon as she had a new horse and madame bernard was not quite willing to trust her alone with a groom no french girl would have sent such an invitation but lucie had acquired during her two years in america all the directness the habit of command the insight into a mans mind of an american girl among the number of things which amazed but charmed paul was the astonishing invention lucie displayed in bringing paul to her side of course there was nothing for him to do but to accept this invitation to protect lucies life so the next afternoon they were cantering gaily through the park toward the highroad with a groom in attendance as they passed the place where count delormes body had been found lucie turned her head away with something like a shudder i always hated him she said until he was killed but you cant hate a dead man i can hate a scoundrel dead or alive replied paul stoutly he ruined your sisters young life he deserved to die a bad death i dont think sophies life is quite ruined said lucie they had brought their horses down to a walk and the groom who had neither eyes nor ears had fallen a little way behind sophie is married to the man she lovesi am sure she would not change captain ravenel for a marshal of france if she could get him she has had great sorrows but she has had great happiness too i know perfectly well what sophie did and it was not right but she was cruelly punished for it paul who was thoroughly french in his ideas of young ladies was much scandalized at this speech of lucies but lucie was more american than french and paul knew the limpid innocence of her mind still he thought that lucie should be more guarded in her speech and thought that if he had the rare good fortune of marrying her he would make her a little more prudent they soon struck the highroad and presently were passing through a forest which was intersected by many roads a crackling of shots was heard in the distancethe troopers were practising at the rifle butts paul turned to the groom and told him to ride forward and find out where the butts were and just then toni appeared saluting paul toni said pardon sir but the orders are that no one shall be allowed to cross this road and you will have to remain sir if you please on this side but this ladys groom is on the other side he will be back presently urged paul very sorry sir said toni with an air of polite determination but those are the orders and then paul and toni saluted gravely and toni backed off this meant that paul and lucie would have to take their ride alone through the woods paul turned to lucie and said you see mademoiselle how it isit can not be helped and i am sure i dont wish it to be helped responded lucie in that daredevil american manner of hers which shocked and charmed paul now we can talk freely there was however a road by which they could get back to the highway and along this they rode in the bright autumn afternoon presently they came to a rivulet into which a little spring bubbled they stopped to let the horses drink and when they were on the other side lucie suddenly raised up and cried i want some water too and before paul could say a word she had slid off her horse and gathering up the skirt to her habit ran to the spring she pulled off her gloves and dipping up the water in the hollow of her little hand pretended to drink it while it splashed all over her fresh fair face paul swung himself off his horse and leaning up against a tree watched lucie with adoration in his eyes she had the unconscious grace of a child but lucie was no childshe was a woman of gentle yet fixed resolve of strong and tender feelings she was in love with paul and had been ever since she took his english book away from him that summer afternoon in the park at bienville so many years ago and reading pauls mind as she had read that english book she saw exactly what was in itthat he was in love with her and withheld by pride diffidence and generosity all three excellent qualities in a mans love and lucie having much practical american sense in her charming head had realized that an heiress has to be very prudent in the man she marries and that of all who professed to love her paul was the only one who loved her well and would not tell her of it she looked at him her face dimpling with laughter he was such a great goose standing there his eyes devouring her and gnawing his mustache for fear the words would come out that he wished to hold in paul she said in a soft little voice and paul against his will was forced to respond lucie come here said lucie paul camehe could no more have held back than he could have stopped breathing lend me your handkerchief paul look his handkerchief out and lucie wiped her hands upon it and then without so much as saying by your leave stuck it back in the breast of his coat this paul thought delightful but it was not propriety paul said lucie suppose war were raging now and you knew there would be a desperate battle tomorrow what would you say to me now if you thought this were the very last interview we were to have before you went out on the firing line paul verney was a man after all and his reply to this was very obvious i should say lucie i love you he replied holding out his hand in which lucie put hers thank heaven cried lucie at last i would have proposed to you long before if you had given me the least encouragement for i made up my mind to marry you just as soon as you made up your mind that you loved me she was laughing but her eyes were dark with feeling and bright with tears i have not asked you to marry me whispered paul his voice trembling a little i told you i loved youno man ever loved a woman more than i love youbut i dont think that i am any match for you lucie and it never seemed to me quite right that i should take advantage of all the childish things you said to me when we were boy and girl or of your rashness and imprudence now for lucie you are a very rash and imprudent girl i am the most prudent person living whispered lucie sidling up to him i dont wish to be married for my money and you are the only man i know who would marry me quicker without my fortune than with itso paul paul made one last hopeless and quite desperate stand oh lucie he said what a villain i am ever to have gone near you after i saw so you saw it did you said lucie smiling but still trembling everybody else saw itthe groom knows it actuallyits quite ridiculousand then paul surrendered a sudden revelation came to him from lucies eyes that his two thousand francs a year mattered no more than her millionsthat it was not a question of francs but of the great master passion which when it enters lordly into the abode of a mans or a womans heart drives out everything else and reigns supreme they sat on a fallen tree and talked in whispers those echoes of the heart until the shadows grew long and it was lucie who had to remind paul that it was time to go home the horses which had stood still meanwhile cocked their ears knowingly at paul when he swung lucie into her saddle they never saw the belated groom at all nor cared what had become of him as they rode back through the dying glow of the autumn afternoon to the chateau bernard lucie ran up the stone steps of the chateau followed by paul at the prospect of meeting madame bernard this dashing young sublieutenant of dragoons felt as hopeless and helpless as a drenched hen it was one thing to tell lucie of his love in the forest glade to the music of the silvery rippling spring with the red sun making a somber glory all around them and with no one except the horses to listen but to tell the chatelaine of the chateau bernard about his two thousand francs the year was almost more than paul could stand lucie led the way into madame bernards little drawingroom a wood fire was crackling on the hearth for the evening had grown chilly and madame bernard stately and timid imposing and nervous with her everlasting embroidery sat by the table on which stood candles in tall silver candlesticks lucie went up and putting her arm around the neck of the fierceeyed and cravenhearted old lady and seating herself on the arm of the chair tipped the handsome old face up and kissed her grandmama she said i have proposed and have been accepted paul says he will marry me paul glared at lucie she was such an unconscionable joker he came forward however and said in his best manner which was a very fine manner madame it is i who proposed to mademoiselle lucie if i did not love her so much i should apologize for it because i feel that she is entitled to more of birth and of fortune and of rank than i can give her but i can give her more devotion and loyalty than any other man livingof that i feel sure paul fully expected madame bernard to box his ears and call a footman to throw him out of the house but madame bernard did nothing of the sort she sighed a little and looked at paul she would have liked a duke at least for lucieshe had got a count for sophie but how wretchedly had that match turned out the habit of obedience was strong upon madame bernard and lucie was of a nature so willing to take responsibility for herself that it was always difficult to take responsibility for her madame bernard knew she was helpless but as paul had done she made a feint of resistance of course monsieur she said in a voice and manner which she vainly tried to make commanding in the event this marriage comes off i shall expect you to resign from the army paul turned pale this thought had never occurred to him before resign from the army and become gentleman usher to a rich wife never madame he said i have little to offer mademoiselle lucie and the best thing in a worldly point of view is the career that i hope to make in my profession that i may say if you will permit me will not be unworthy of mademoiselle lucies acceptance i trust good for you paul cried lucie what you say is quite right and grandmama you might as well make up your mind to it when paul and i are married i shall have to live in all sorts of dull little towns and poky little holes and perhaps go to algiers i shall have to do just what any other sublieutenants wife has to do and i shall like it above all things it will be like a masquerade for we shall know when paul is a lieutenantcolonel then we can live handsomely and enjoy our money lucies quick and comprehensive mind had already gone forward and spanned the gulf between a sublieutenant and a lieutenantcolonel madame bernard sighed again all womanly women are natural romancers and love a lover and she did not think less of paul for his determined stand she began to see dimly that this prompt and quiet decision in pauls character was one of the reasons why lucie loved him and it would be the most wholesome corrective possible to the faults in lucies temperament as to the question of my consent monsieur said madame bernard grimly that seems to have been settled in advance by lucie and yourself lucie chased away the grimness from the old ladys face by kissing her suppose we postpone consideration of this for a short timea week perhaps you will allow me paul was about to say certainly madame when lucie interrupted him say yes paul it will amuse grandmama and wont hurt us the least in the world and then she kissed madame bernard all over her face and cried go home paul and come early tomorrow grandmama will be dying to see you paul left the chateau in much better case than he expected and had a rapturous ride back in the twilight with a shy young moon looking and laughing at him as he rode into the barracks yard he passed toni carrying a big bucket of water in either hand as he rode past he said in a whisper you brought me good fortune today and its all settled asked toni in another whisper quite so i think replied paul flinging himself off his horse i will do a good turn by you with the sergeant tomorrow morning when he got back to his quarters powder who had spent a lonely afternoon rushed at him with yaps of delight paul twisting the dogs ears whispered my lad you and i have just got a new commanding officer hurrah you rascal and powder immediately gave a series of terrific yelps which he had been taught to believe were hurrahs the next morning paul had two errands which took him out very early one was to send a bouquet to lucie and the other was to have an interview with sergeant duval he caught the sergeant just coming out of the ridinghall everything had gone well that day and the sergeant was smiling well sergeant cried paul coming up to him so i understand that my old friend toni and mademoiselle denise are to be married i had not heard the news sir responded sergeant duval stiffening i thank you for acquainting me with it the fact is said paul toni is terribly afraid of you and he asked me to make the communication i thought perhaps something had passed between your sister and tonis mother but at all events you know as much about toni as anybody he is an excellent fellow a fine soldier and has been in love with mademoiselle denise ever since he was a small boy there were more small bad boys in bienville than any place i ever saw sir was the sergeants discouraging reply and toni was about the worst of the lot come now sergeant you are too hard on toni he was no worse than i was all small boys are bad but all of them that i have ever seen had something good about them madame marcel you know is welltodo and when tonis time is up he can get a place i know as instructor in a ridingschool at three hundred francs the month i dont think mademoiselle denise will do ill if you take toni for a soninlaw the sergeant twisted his mustache reflectively and beside that continued paul who had become a marvel of duplicity i understand that madame marcel is smiling on you a remarkably fine handsome man you are sergeant and i am not surprised that madame marcel likes you but she would like you a great deal better if you would give denise to toni you see it would be a nice family arrangement a pleased grin overspread the sergeants face well sir he replied a man does not take a husband for his only child without looking well about him it is true that madame marcel is welltodo and i could tie up denises dowry so that toni couldnt touch it and perhaps i will think it over sir and let you know the sergeants views on the subject of tonis marriage to denise were very much enlightened that afternoon by madame marcels requesting an interview with him in her own room the sergeant arrayed himself in his best uniform paid a visit to the barber waxed and dyed his mustaches to the ultimate point and then presented himself at madame marcels door madame marcel was the most unsophisticated of women but this did not mean that she could not play a part and play it well her part was to persuade the sergeant that after toni and denise were married she herself might become madame duval a thing she had not the slightest idea of doing so she received the sergeant in the most gracious manner smiled at him talked about the happiness of their children and seemed to think that married life was the only road to real bliss and that one could not marry too early or too often the sergeant saw that she had set her heart on the marriage between toni and denise and that he would stand no chance whatever of establishing himself in the comfortable back room of madame marcels shop unless he agreed to the match so far he was quite correct but in his further assumption that by agreeing to it he was making good his title to the armed chair which he coveted by the kitchen stove he was miles out of the way the result however was the samethat after much running to and fro and as many legal documents for denises ten thousand francs as for lucies fortune the matter was arranged and on the day fortnight that they had made a family party to the golden lion and had eaten and drunk in the garden they made an excursion to the same place to celebrate the betrothal of toni and denise it was too late then to sit out of doors so they had their little feast in a private room of the golden lion with a glowing fire on the hearth madame marcel insisted on being the hostess on this occasion and ordered a truly gorgeous supper there was a heartshaped cake on the table with love birds pecking at orange blossoms and all the candies were hearts and darts and loves and doves everything wore a sort of st valentines air denise in a beautiful pink silk gown sat next toni at the table there were several of the duvals friends and two or three of tonis comrades when it was time to drink the brides health toni went a message out to where madame bernards carriage stood in the courtyard out stepped paul and lucie leaving madame bernard in the carriage when they appeared in the supperroom there was a general commotion toni had kept this impending honor a secret from every one except denise and sergeant duval was the more impressed by the compliment of paul verneys coming through having it sprung on him as a surprise lucie shook hands with toni kissed denise on the cheek remembered the sergeant and mademoiselle duval and madame marcel bestowed bows and smiles on all present and as she always did brought an atmosphere of kindness and gaiety with her paul shook tonis hand and pronounced an eulogy upon him looking gravely into tonis eyes at the time and neither one of them winked he spoke as if when tonis time was up and he should leave the regiment he would be as much missed as the colonel himself then he proposed the health of the betrothed pair and it was drunk with all honors the two pairs of lovers looked at each otherit recalled their childish days at bienville how seldom does the course of true love run smooth and how smoothly had it run for them then lucie and paul left having almost persuaded the duval faction that they had done themselves great honor by securing toni for denise the next morning it was paul verneys turn at the ridingschool and as he walked along in the crisp autumn air feeling as if heaven was around him as well as above him he came face to face with toni tonis eyes were wide and dark with terror his face was pale and he gnawed his mustache furiously the change since paul had seen him the night before was enough to shock any one toni did not wait to be asked what was the matter but coming close to paul said in his ear they are herepierre and nicolasthey lay in wait for me when i got back to the barracks last nightthey were in the batch of recruits that came in yesterday what of it said paul who was not easily shaken they told me that unless i stood by them they would tell all aboutthosethose things that happened when i was in the circus and about count delormes death and the rest of it you know sir i am as innocentas innocent he pointed upward to a bird that sang and swung upon a bough close by his speech seemed to fail him nicolas and pierre in a single night had resumed all their old sway over him he was once more under the dominion of fear they were not conscripted those two rascals said paul no they told me that the authorities were hot after them about the delorme matter a twentyfranc piece was found which had a mark on it and was traced to count delorme it was the piece which they put in my pocket and which i threw after them nothing could actually be discovered against them but they could not well get out of the way so they concluded the best thing to do was to enlist in a dragoon regiment and as they couldnt get away from this part of the country they thought it best not to try and so came here toni wiped his forehead on which the big drops stood tonipaul spoke sharplybe a man do you suppose when denise promised to marry you that she thought she was marrying a poltroon to be scared by a ghostafraid of a whisk of a rabbits tail toni groaned heavily the little while that he had been free from fear of his secret made its return seem the more dreadful to him itsitsits a very horrible thing to feel that you have two men at your heels ready to swear that you have been engaged in murder and robbery and arson but if you have not committed murder and robbery and arson you have nothing to fear replied paul speaking sternly toni made no answer but shook his head paul then tried persuasion on him but nothing could lessen tonis fear of his two old companions paul went on to the ridingschool pierre and nicolas proud of their accomplishments as riders were anxious to exhibit their skill neither of them was as graceful a rider as toni though and nicolas was beetlebrowed and redheaded while pierre was a combination of a fox and a monkey sergeant duval was a judge of men and not all their accomplishments inclined him favorably toward them nor did he after a months trial have reason to reverse his opinion for from the beginning two worse soldiers could not be found they were always under punishment they either would not or could not learn their duty and it was a source of regret to their superiors that they would receive so many punishments they would probably be obliged to serve another enlistment the sergeant did his whole duty in reporting them and paul verney in whose troop they were in punishing them paul very much hoped that they would reach the limit and have to be sent to algiers as  disciplinaires  toni went about like a man in a dream part of the time he was the happiest fellow alive and part of the time the most miserable in his happiest moments with denise he was haunted by a dread of what nicolas and pierre might do and in his paroxysms of fear when he waked in the night and lay still and trembling amid the snoring troopers around him in the barracks the thought of denise comforted him for denise found out that there was something the matter with him and gently chid him for not telling her and when toni would not for indeed he could not poor frightened fellow that he was tell her denise did not grow petulant but showed him a tender confidence there was much more in denise than mere prettiness and blondness and neatness and coquetry she was a soldiers daughter and was not without some of sergeant duvals resolution so toni found that with all his grief and anxiety he had the quiet unspoken and therefore more helpful sympathy of the woman he loved denise did not worry him with questionsthat was much the sergeant and all the men in the troop knew of tonis former associations in the circus with nicolas and pierre but as neither of the two latter had succeeded in making himself an object of admiration to his comrades nothing they could say would injure toni still they maintained their strange power over him toni would have liked never to speak to them nor to be seen with them but when they would come after him he had no capacity of resistancehe would go with them cursing them but unable to withstand them in the spring he was relieved of some of this pierre and nicolas had taken a special spite against their sublieutenant paul verney and they had shamefully abused one of his favorite chargers paul promptly procured for them two months incarceration in the military prison these were two months of paradise to toni he had in him something of a happygolucky disposition and although he could not shake off his miserable secret he could put it out of sight for a while it did not trouble him much in the day but never failed to visit him at night it was known by that time that he was to marry denise when the sergeant should retire on his pension which would be a year from the coming summer like a lover toni had protested strongly against this but as a matteroffact it did not greatly affect his happiness he liked playing the part of a lover and reasoned with true toni philosophy that he might well enjoy the present without hungering too much after the future he saw denise every day danced with her three times a week spent every sunday when he was off duty with her and ate several times a week most agreeable dishes prepared by denises own hands madame marcel meanwhile had returned to bienville but promised to make toni another visit before long she left the sergeant far from hopeless and by enclosing a special package of chocolate in the new year box which she sent toni and denise gave him great hopes in fact under tonis able instruction madame marcel was playing the sergeant with great skill and finesse and that infatuated person never suspected it it was a happy time with paul verney too like toni he was an accepted lover but his marriage was to come off in june he had taken a small pretty house in the town for although madame bernard urged and even commanded that the new married pair should live with her paul verney had a sturdy independence about him his two thousand francs would pay the rent of his house and his parents by skimping and screwing in every possible way managed to scrape up two thousand francs more without letting paul know how much it encroached on their narrow income but lucie with her quick american sense saw through it in an instant and positively refused to let paul take it under any circumstances paul she said when the subject was broached between them i am willing to play at being poor for your sake and for the looks of the thing but how absurd it is for us not to enjoy what is ours what is yours you mean mumbled paul but yours and ours do not exist between persons who love and understand each other as we do i wish from the bottom of my heart it were yours instead of minethen i should not have to be so particular always to say ours so paul verney like other men had to yield to the inevitable feminine and although they were to live modestly enough it was as lucie said mere playing at poverty it seemed to paul in fulfilling his childish romance as toni had fulfilled his that they were drawn nearer together even than when they were boys at bienville the relation of master and servant which had always been a fiction of the imagination so to speak seemed to vanish wholly toni was pauls humble friend and confidant when paul would come home after dining at the chateau bernard and an evening spent basking in lucies smiles and glances he would feel as if he were stepping on air and there toni would be standing at the window drawing pictures of denise in an old copybook he would glance with a roguish smile at paul as he helped him off with his clothes and say mademoiselle has been kind tonight hasnt she yes she is always kindthe darling paul would reply and the old lady when she is got up in her velvet gown and her big silk mantle and her bonnet with plumes on it she always reminds me of the generals charger at a grand parade and she is about as much to be feared said paul laughing i would rather encounter a dozen madame bernards than one sergeant duval i think the sergeant lives for the purpose of catching you trippingthat is to say in the event that your mother doesnt marry him women are the oddest creatures in the world toni said solemnly blinking his eyes theres my mother she has been a widow for twenty years and if you believe me the way she is fooling the sergeant would put a sixteenyearold girl to the blush then toni told about the box of chocolate and it will be boxes of chocolate straight along until she gets me married to denise and thenpoufaway will go the sergeant she would not marry him to save his life the sergeant is a fine man toobetter than i am but she loves me best these hours of confidence were not among the least pleasant in the lives of paul and toni early in the month of june the month of roses the wedding of paul and lucie came off the civil wedding occurred one day but the great event was the religious ceremony on the next day it took place in the garrison chapel which was beautifully decorated for the occasion it was a very grand wedding for the bernards were great people but it was likewise a very happy wedding a great many persons wondered why a girl of lucie bernards beauty fortune and position should marry a little sublieutenant of dragoons but when they came to see and know the little sublieutenant and how much liked and respected he was by everybody it did not seem remarkable at all lucies most valued wedding present was a huge amethyst bracelet bought by the voluntary subscriptions of the men in pauls own troop out of their small pay lucie wore it at her wedding her only other ornament being a modest pearl brooch which was pauls gift it was a glorious june day when lucie bernard became lucie verney the garrison chapel was packed and sergeant duval commanded the guard of honor toni who had helped to dress paul for the great occasion scampered off with powder under his arm to the church where he met denise and her aunt he escorted them to seats of honor reserved for them a compliment to toni which materially improved his standing with mademoiselle duval the church was filled with music from the great organ and outside the air was melodious with the song of birds and the rustling of leaves and the swaying of blossoms among the happiest faces in the church were those of monsieur and madame verney and also two persons that toni had not seen for a long time captain and madame ravenel madame ravenel was for once not in black and her pale beauty was set off by a white gown her usually sad face wore a happy and tremulous smile she felt herself the forgiven sinner and was not as most sinners are proud of her sins and contemptuous of their forgiveness lucie had demanded that sophie and her husband be asked to the wedding and even to stay as guests at the chateau bernard madame bernard after having protested vowed and declared for six months that such should not be the case promptly capitulated three weeks before the wedding this meant the complete rehabilitation of captain and madame ravenel and their return to that world from which their own desperate act had hurled them for a time they had humbled themselves and had been punished and had taken their punishment as proud and honorable souls do acknowledging its justice and making no outcry but now it was over and forgiveness had been won for them by lucie bernards generous and determined little hand which had never ceased to labor for them since she was ten years old while the church full of people was awaiting the entrance of the bride and bridegroom toni whispered to denise that they would be married in the same church and that he expected to be as happy as monsieur paul who was the happiest man he had ever seen pauls countenance when he stood before the altar with lucie on his arm fully sustained this many bridegrooms wear a hunted and dejected appearance but not so paul verney although he had been hunted and captured by the charming creature at his side lucie for once was subdued but her pallor and the tears that trembled in her dark eyes did her as much honor as pauls happy countenance she was asking herself all the time if she were really worthy of a man like paul but she recovered all her composure when they turned and marched out of the church together and passed under the uplifted swords of the guard of honor and she was quite smiling and selfpossessed looking about her with the laughing playful penetrating glance peculiarly her own and holding up her arm on which the big bracelet shone to the delight of the honest hearts of the soldiers there was a large wedding breakfast at the chateau bernard which was at its loveliest in june with its broad green terraces its plashing fountains and the riot of color in its prim flower beds the guests sat at many little tables on the broad terrace where the bride and groom and the wedding party had a very gorgeous one in the middle just by the fountain which sparkled brilliantly in the sunshine a little way off in a grove of elm trees a table was set for the soldiers who had acted as the guard of honor at the wedding ceremony their wives and sweethearts were included and here toni was the great man second only to sergeant duval who was the ranking noncommissioned officer present toni was the bridegrooms humble friend and everybody knew the closeness of the tie which had existed between them since boyhood toni made a speech which was a marvel of elegance and correctness it had been written for him by paul verney two weeks before and he had spent the whole fortnight getting it by heart but at the end toni suddenly burst into an impromptu speech of his own the lieutenant he said is the best lieutenant he is the best man he is the best master he is the best of everything here toni without the least expectation on his part suddenly found the tears rolling down his cheeks he laughed and could not imagine what he was crying for and then his fellows all applauded him vociferously and toni sat down and was not able to say another word and then when they were through with their breakfast they saw the bride and groom approaching lucie holding up her dainty white skirts her filmy veil floating about her and with nothing on her dark hair except her wedding veil and wreath paul carried his helmet with its horsehair plume in his hand and the sun shone on his happy sunburned face as he led lucie to where their humble friends were making merry toni had hauled out from under the table a mysterious box filled with ice and with longnecked bottles and champagne was soon bubbling in every glass the sergeant made a speech quite out of his own head and much better than tonis in which he assured paul verney of what he knew beforethat his troop would die for him to a man paul returned thanks and declared that he was conscious of commanding the finest troop in the french army and then lucie said a few pretty words of thanks and held up her arm with the great bracelet on it and showed that she had worn no other ornament except that and the bridegrooms gift then there were more cheers more champagne more of everything it was a very happy wedding because it made many persons happy the very happiest person at the wedding next to paul and lucie was madame verney that excellent woman was fully persuaded that by her efforts alone and singlehanded she had brought about this match between paul and lucie which otherwise never would have taken place the relatives and friends of the bernards were very grand people indeed but paul had no reason to be ashamed of his family contingent when the guests were all gone and only the family remained toni requested paul to let the party from bienville consisting of himself and the duvals speak to the bienville persons presentthe verneys and the ravenelsand this paul very gladly did the ravenels and the verneys were very kind as was their nature to their humbler friends from their native town paul did toni a very good service by proclaiming before all the bienville people in sergeant duvals presence that toni was the best fellow alive and the sergeant was doing well to betroth his daughter to such an excellent fellow this was accepted by the bienville people because on that glorious day everything went well they could not but observe however that toni was clean instead of being dirty and paul assured them that he had become as industrious as he had before been idle when the carriage drove off in the summer dusk with the bride and groom starting on their wedding journey toni was the last person with whom they shook hands as he arranged them comfortably and then toni whispered to denise we will be just as happy as they some day the next morning toni waked up with a feeling of happiness which had been gradually growing on him ever since he had become a private soldier under paul verney this made him long to whistle and sing like a blackbird had not the regulations forbidden soldiers to sing like blackbirds while at their duties but the first sight that greeted him as he marched on the parade ground gave him an unpleasant shock there were nicolas and pierre in the ranks their term of imprisonment had expired and these two unworthy citizens were restored to their duties toni avoided them all day long as much as he could and in the evening being off duty he went into the town to see denise after spending half an hour with her sitting on a bench in the public square while mademoiselle duval read her inevitable religious newspaper a drizzle of rain coming on he escorted his fiancee and his future auntinlaw to their lodging then walked down into the town to spend the hour that yet remained to him before he was obliged to turn in the night had grown dark and stormy and the rain had become a determined downpour the street lamps shone fitfully out of the gloom but the windows of the cheap cafes where the soldiers congregated were resplendent with lights toni was standing before one of these and debating whether he should go in when he felt an arm on each side of him he looked around and nicolas red head was close to his ear while pierres monkey face was on the other side of him come said nicolas i know where we can get a good bottle of wine and have a game of cards toni could easily have wrenched himself free from them but his old cowardice returned to him with a rush he went sullenly with them under a moral compulsion which he could not have explained to save his life he hated and feared their company nevertheless he went with them they turned into a dark and narrow side street and then diving into a blind alley so dark and noisome that tonis heart sank within him at the thought of the crimes that could be committed there they climbed a rickety outside stair by the side of a tumbledown old house toni found himself presently in a garret room dimly lighted by a malodorous oil lamp it was evidently a place of entertainment for a low class of persons there were sounds of voices below them and next them but this room was unoccupied there was a table in the middle of the floor and wine and glasses on it toni sat down much against his will and pierre pouring out some of the wine which was vile began to expatiate on the delights of liberty this is a million times better he said than being locked up in prison with the devil of a sentry keeping his eye on one perpetually and three days on bread and water for sneezing toni longed to say that that was what both of them richly deserved but dared not then nicolas began we should not have been imprisoned at all but for that scoundrel lieutenant verney he has a spite against us and takes it out as only an officer can on a private soldier its a lie cried toni this aspersion on their honor was not in the least resented by either pierre or nicolas who knew as only they and god did what liars they were well toni nicolas continued i understand that you are to marry the sergeants daughter my faith you look prosperous count delormes money must have done you a lot of good i never had any of count delormes money burst out toni who is lying now murmured nicolas softly what about the twentyfranc piece that was certainly a very neat job of yours toni said pierre i have never seen a man done for quicker than you did for count delorme one blow like this he drew off and went through a pantomime of giving nicolas a blow on the side of the head nicolas likewise pretending tumbled over in his chair as count delorme had fallen over in the dark at the chateau bernard it made toni sick to see them they laughed after they had gone through with this mimic tragedy and began to drink their wine then they again abused paul verney and toni said nothing he scorned to defend his friend from two such scoundrels as those before him and he longed to get away but that strange and inscrutable fear of them nailed him to his chair presently nicolas said to him toni we might as well tell you the truth lieutenant verney is to die to die paul so full of life so happy only yesterday married he saw pauls smiling face as he waved his hand back to toni when he drove off in the open carriage with lucie through the golden dusk of the june evening but he did not quite take in what nicolas meant yes said pierre have you never heard my man of officers who abused and illtreated their men who were found dead like count delormei wont say murderedthats an ugly word to say but it isnt altogether safe for an officer to persecute a man particularly a couple of menits just as well to make an example of an officer like that once in a while a cold horror came upon toni after a moment he spoke so you mean to waylay lieutenant verney as you did count delorme he asked no indeed my dear fellow briskly responded nicolas it will be quite a different affair from that little one of yours we mean to kill him however but we will try our chances among the three of us we dont care to take the whole risk ourselves and i think considering how quiet we have kept about that little affair of yours in the park of the chateau bernard that you ought to help us out so we will play a game of cards and the loser is to finish up lieutenant verney or be finished up himself that is quite fair dont you agree to that pierre pierre nodded and grinned toni sat looking at them stupidly by the light of the oil lamp he took in instantly what they meantthey intended that he should kill paul verney or else be killed himself nicolas took out of his pocket a greasy pack of cards and said what shall it beecarte as you please responded pierre toni would have given his soul almost to have rushed out of the room but he was toni still as boy and man he had been cowed and enslaved by certain strange fears which many persons exercised over him and these scoundrels in particular he thought of himself as murdered by these wretches who he knew would do it with as little compunction as they would wring the neck of a chicken he thought of denise of paul verney and he was overwhelmed with sorrow for them and pity for himself for he understood that he must die the cards were dealt and toni took his up he was in a horrible dream but he retained enough of his faculties to know how the game was going nicolas and pierre were quite cheerful and they squabbled merrily over the game and took all the tricks when they had finished nicolas slapped toni on the back and said jovially well my man you have got the job toni made no reply he was too frightened to speak and then nicolas suddenly growing perfectly serious said you know we begin our practice marches in about a fortnight now on our first practice march you are to be ill and drop out of the ranksseewhen the lieutenant is riding by the side of the troop where he can see you and you must select a place where there is a thicket in which a mans body can be hid from the observation of the people passing by now when the lieutenant comes back to see what is the matter with you it will be quite easyhe will be completely off his guardand thenyou had better do it with a knifea knife makes no noise you know and if you dont know how to use a knife on lieutenant verneywell well use it on youthats alland on lieutenant verney later tonis arms dropped by his side and he uttered a low groan what folly ever had thrown him with these menwhat madness was his not to have come out and told the truth about count delorme and now his life must pay the penalty for it and just as it was growing so sweet to him he staggered to his feet and groped his way to the door pierre and nicolas making no effort to stop him they saw that they had fully impressed him with what they meant to do toni got back to the barracks he knew not how stumbling along through the rain and darkness and throwing himself on his rough bed lay awake and agonized the whole night through until the bugle call next morning he could not eat that whole day nor sleep the next night and pined like a woman during that day he saw nicolas and pierre a dozen times at least and they always flashed him a mocking glance which he understood perfectly well and which gave him a feeling as if a redhot iron hand were clutching his heart for toni was of an imaginative nature he did not see denise that day and spent another sleepless and horrorstricken night the next morning it occurred to him as a means of escaping denises tender and searching eyes as well as the hateful company of pierre and nicolas that he might possibly sham illness and be sent to the hospital he did not need to sham howeverhe was in a high fever and the surgeon swore at him for not reporting before so he found a temporary haven of refuge in the hospital there he spent several days the doctor who was a clever young fellow was a good deal puzzled by the case he could not make out whether toni was malingering or not he evidently wished to be considered illat the same time there were indications about him of his being really ill if he had not had the reputation of being an admirable soldier the doctor would have suspected toni had done something wrong and was in hiding as it were in the hospital the sergeant called to see him and was rather rough with him considering that nothing was the matter with toni do you think i would lie here and take all these nasty messes if there were nothing the matter with me cried poor toni there was indeed something very serious the matter with him but it was a kind of suffering which not all the doctors instruments and medicines could reach denise with her aunt called twice to see him but both times toni feigned to be asleep as soon as he distinguished their voices and it was against the rules to disturb him a week passed on the second morning of which he found a long sharp knife under his pillow and at the end of that time the doctor turned toni out of the hospital much against the latters will he had then to resume his duties of course and affect cheerfulness as well as he could he succeeded rather better in the last respect than might have been expected and denise only saw in him the weakness and lassitude which she thought were due to his recent illness on the day fortnight after paul verneys wedding he returned with his bridethe honeymoon of a sublieutenant is inevitably brief the very next day the practice march was to begin and toni did not see paul verney until the next morning when the troop was forming in the barracks square the regiment marched out with colors flying to do a practice march of two days duration paul was riding at the head of his troop he was a fine horseman and had a good military air and everything about him was spick and span as becomes an officer toni who was at the end of the file got a good look at paul as he cantered along by the side of the troopers and a look of affectionate intelligence flashed between the two young men toni saw that paul was truly happyhe was in fact always happy when performing his military duties because he was born a soldier apt at obedience and ready at command in the same file with toni rode nicolas and pierre they passed out of the town on the dusty highroad their helmets gleaming in the sun and the steady tramp of their horses hoofs sounding like thunder on the highroad and raising a great white dust like a pillar of cloud by day crowds of people ran out to see them and cheered them as they passed the day was bright and warm but not hot enough to distress either the men or the horses they kept on steadily until noon when there was an hour of rest and refreshment again they took up the line of march a cool breeze was blowing and it was as pleasant a june day as one could wish for marching towards three oclock as they were passing the outskirts of a wood toni put his hand to his head and reeled in his saddle his horse kept on steadily in the ranks it was very well simulated and paul rode up and caught toni by the arm you had better drop out he said and rest a while by the roadside and rejoin when you feel better toni touched his cap and said thank you sir and slipping out of his saddle led his horse to a grassy place under a tree where he sat down and mopped his face he looked quite pale and weak but the surgeon when he rode up gave him a sharp look made him drink some wine and water out of his canteen and said you will be all right in ten minutes and rode on ten minutes passed and twenty and thirty the regiment was out of sight tonis troop was a part of the rear guard the dull echo of thousands of hoofs still resounded afar off but all else was quiet in that shaded woody spot with farmhouses basking in the sun the highroad gleaming whitely and the railway beyond making two streaks of steelblue light in the distance toni with his helmet off and his horse browsing quietly near him sat on the ground under the shade with the glaring midday light around him and waited for paul verney who he knew would return no lieutenant in the regiment looked so closely after his men as he presently toni heard the galloping of a horse and the rattling of a saber in its scabbard and there was paul riding up he swung himself off his horse and came up to toni and said i came back to see what was the matter with you i thought you would have rejoined by this time toni made no reply but raised his black eyes to pauls blue ones and they were so full of misery that paul involuntarily put his hand on tonis shoulder and asked what is it toni tried to speak but the words would not come paul putting his hand in his breast drew out a small flask of brandy and poured the best part of it down tonis throat now he said tell me what it is tonis vocabulary was not extensive and he hunted around in his mind for language to express the horror of what he was suffering but he could only find the simplest words nicolas and pierre he said those scoundrelshave ordered me to kill you they say if i dont they will kill me and kill you afterward themselves there was silence for a minute or two after this paul knew very well that toni was neither drunk nor crazy and he grasped at once all that toni meant his face grew pale and his blond mustache twitched a little so they want to put me out of the waywhat for because they think you are responsible for their being in trouble so much they are desperate men paul toni used pauls name unconsciously but he was thinking then of paul as he had known him years ago an applecheeked boy who understood him and even understood jacques paul took his helmet off and let the cool breeze blow on his closecropped sandy hair come now he said tell me all about ithow it happened it is about count delorme said toni gasping between his sentences you know paul i always was a coward about most things yes i know and when i was in the circus those two rascals used to take me with them sometimes on their robbing expeditions and make me keep watch and help to carry off the stolen things i was frightened to death at what they made me dotoo frightened to refuse to go with them i never knew of their killing anybody except count delorme but that night they waylaid him in the dark i swear to youoh god i swear to you a million timesi never touched count delorme i thought they were going to rob him onlyi did not dream they were going to kill him but he resisted when they tried to get his money and nicolas struck him a blow and he fell over and they put a twentyfranc piece in my pocket and swore that i had killed him and robbed him then i determined to get away from them and so when i was conscripted i could have got off because i was the only son of a widow but i thought if i were in the army i might escape them and i meant then to hunt for you and to tell you all about it and i thought i had escaped themoh how happy i wasbut they turned up as you know and i have not had a moments peace since two weeks ago they forced me to go with them forced you to go with them said paul indignantly toni you are the greatest coward i know it replied toni i always was and they told me that they meant to kill you and we played a game of cards to determine whether they should do it or i i think of it of course i lost and they promised me if i didnt kill you that i should be killed and they told me to drop out of the ranks and that you would come after me and they put this knife where i could find it toni drew it from his bosom it was an ordinary table knife but of welltempered steel and as sharp as a razor and i was to kill you and leave your body here where it could not be found for several hoursand make the best of my way off of course i should have been caught and guillotined but what did they care about that toni turned and threw the knife as far as he could into the bosky thicket behind him paul verney who was as quiet as a lamb and as brave as a lion looked at toni sorrowfully i think i can get rid of those two rapscallions in time he said get them sent to algiers but they will have to come back sometime thats what i know said toni we are under sentence of death paul and it is all my fault the ghost of a smile came into paul verneys face no he answered not exactly your fault toni you were born that way so you cant help yourself and we are both so happy cried toni and at this he burst into a passion of tears sobbing as he had not sobbed since he was a small boy and his mother had the rheumatism and he thought she was going to die paul turned his back and walked up and down in front of toni for a minute or two and when he spoke his voice was husky yes he said we are both very happy or would be except for those wretches but toni you must keep every hint of this from denise and i shall certainly keep it from my wife you may be able to replied poor toni because you are brave and selfpossessed but you know how i am i am likely to let it out any time if you do said paul sternly you may look to hear from me toni have you no shame at being such a coward not a bit replied toni as you say i was born that way i am not afraid of horses nor of guns nor of anything that other people are afraid of paul inspected toni in wrath and sorrow he was the identical toni that had enjoyed a ride on the runaway horse and was cowed and terrified by the laughs and jeers of a couple of the tailor clerys boys either of whom he was perfectly well able to thrash if he had wished paul verney was not physically half the man that toni was but not all the five clery boys with their father at their head could have frightened him when he was a very small boy himself paul would have taken a thrashing from them one day and be ready to repeat it the next but the mere thought of a thrashing frightened toni out of his wits how much more then did the thought of being murdered scare him yet if toni had been driven into the forlorn hopethe last children as the french picturesquely put ithe would have behaved as well as any man in it paul verney looked around him at the smiling peaceful landscape basking in the afternoon light and thought of lucie at the chateau she was probably practising her music at that hour and then she would go for her afternoon ride with only a groom to accompany her he would be absent from her for two whole days and lucie had spent a week in devising schemes for getting rid of the time paul was as much in love with her as she was with him but it never occurred to him that there was any difficulty in getting rid of the time during his absence from herhe had his work to do and he meant to do it well nor did he let the thought of lucie interfere in the least with his duty he had cheerfully given that promise demanded of all lovers that he would tell lucie everything as he had nothing to tell her of the least harm or of the least consequence he had laughingly made the promise but now there was something he must conceal from her something the mere thought of which would blight that merry beautiful roseinbloom life that lucie was leading something which if it ever came to pass would blight it altogether paul pulled himself together and turned his mind as he had the power to do resolutely away from the grisly probability presented to him toni said he dont think about this thing i believe i can get those two scoundrels out of the way and i will so take another pull out of this brandy flask and get on your horse and follow me toni did as he was told and was soon galloping at paul verneys heels the thought of denise was before him he knew that sometime he should tell herhe could not keep it from herand what would denise say and what would she dobe scared as he was presently they found themselves in the cloud of dust which enveloped the regiment and toni made his way to his place at the end of the file paul verney cantering past as toni reined up he looked around the file and saw the red mustache and ferretlike eyes of nicolas peering out along the line of mustached and helmeted heads nicolas gave him an indescribable looka look with murder in it toni had had his chance and paul verney had come back unharmed that night in the bivouac nicolas and pierre came up to toni and nicolas whispered in his ear you have two more chanceswe will give you three opportunities all together toni said not a word in reply he only wondered dumbly how much of life that meant for him on the afternoon of the day when they returned to beaupre paul verney ordered toni to report to him at the chateau bernard for a message paul and lucie were having tea together at a little table on the terrace when toni arrived anything more brilliant and sparkling than lucies face could not be imagined she smiled charmingly on toni inquired after denise and sent word to her to come to the chateau paul looked as cheerful and composed as ever and said to lucie in quite a matteroffact husbandlike manner i have some business to attend to so i must ask you to excuse me lucie had found out this early in her married life that when paul had business to attend to she must vanish which she did promptly then paul lighting his cigar gaily said to toni standing at attention the picture of dejection well toni i think i have settled those two fellows i had a talk with the colonel about them today and he says that while we were away on the practice march some of their doings came to light and that we would be able to send them to algiers as  disciplinaires  there is a batch going off next week and we shall try to send our friends along with them how long will they be away asked toni that depends replied paul we can only send them for a year as it isif they keep on as they have been behaving here they may have to spend the rest of their lives in algiers but to get them out of the way for the present is good fortune enough i have told the colonel the whole story about count delorme and what a perfectly abject coward you are toni in many ways and he agrees with me that we had better not open the whole subject but just get these two rascals off quietly so if you can manage to keep from bawling like a baby for the next week and will be only half a man the thing can be settled i will try said toni without making any promise of not bawling like a baby the good news however did enable him to keep from letting the whole thing out to denise she found toni rather depressed and unhappy during that week but on the morning when the batch of hard cases was put on the train to be started for marseilles and nicolas and pierre were among them tonis heart bounded with joy he could not deny himself the pleasure of seeing his two old comrades off they were the most sullen and angry of all the sullen and angry  disciplinaires  sent to atone for their misdeeds under the fierce sun of africa as the train moved slowly off nicolas thrust his red head out of the window and shaking his fist at toni cried dont forgetwe shant forget toni however tried his best to forget and succeeded beyond his expectations he had thought himself lucky when nicolas and pierre were out of sight but now when he remembered that they were in africa and called to mind all the chances of fever and cholera and other things that if they befell his two comrades in arms would be of distinct benefit to him he felt positively cheerful and as paul verney said if pierre and nicolas kept up their career as they had done since they had joined the regiment they would probably leave their bones in africa so toni thrusting off his load of care more than he had ever done since that secret of the woods at midnight and the dead man lying stark with his face upturned to the murky sky had been laid upon him grew merry at heart there was a good deal to make him happy then denise was thoroughly devoted to him and the sergeant who was being very skilfully played by madame marcel became perfectly reconciled to the match between toni and denise after all even if sergeant duval did not succeed in marrying madame marcel he reflected that toni would not be ill provided for as madame marcel was extremely well off for a lady of her condition as a means of advancing tonis interests madame marcel was always writing to the sergeant asking him how she should invest such considerable sums as six hundred francs and once even nine hundred francs this last sum was so very imposing that the sergeant in giving her his advice felt compelled to renew his offer of his hand and heart to this madame marcel returned a most diplomatic reply she said if she could see toni married to denise she would feel more like considering the offer at present it was her only desire to see that happy event come off then possibly after providing liberally for toni she might take the sergeants offer under reflection the sergeant after receiving this letter thought himself as good as married to madame marcel the autumn and the winter passed as pleasantly as the summer paul and lucie after spending the summer at the chateau bernard had come into the town and taken the small house in which they played at being poor it was as pretty a little bower as any newlymarried couple ever had they kept only three servants and toni still waited on paul verney and there was plenty for him to do he had no natural love for work and still reckoned it the height of bliss to lie on his stomach in the long grass and watch the gnats dancing in the sun and the foolishly industrious bees always at work for others get gloriously drunk on the clover blossoms but for a private in the dragoons there was not much time for this sort of thing and if toni had to work he would rather work for the verneys than for anybody else there was a little garden behind the house in which toni dug and planted and watered diligently under lucies critical eye and this was the least unpleasant work that he had ever done lucie fathomed his character as well as paul did she knew of all his strange ins and outs his courage and cowardice his foolish loving heart denise by that time had got the upper hand of toni as completely as paul verney had got the upper hand of lucie like all tenderhearted women lucie was a natural and incurable matchmaker nothing pleased her better than to forward the affair between toni and denise she stopped sergeant duval in the street to praise tonis virtues expatiating upon his industry the sergeant listened respectfully enough until tonis industry was mentioned when a grim look came into his eyes yes madame he said he is the most industrious fellow alive as long as i am after him and he has the prospect of being put in the barrack prison on bread and water oh there is nobody who works harder than toni lucie passed on laughing but there was a reason why toni was so willing always to dig in the garden there was a little sewingroom on the ground floor which had a window that opened on the garden and at that window denise early in the winter was established with her sewing she was a beautiful seamstress and having ten thousand francs to her fortune by no means lessened her inclination to work for the good wages which madame verney paid her and there was a great deal of sewing to be done just then in the little house so while toni dug and planted in the garden and worked among the flowers in the little greenhouse he could glance up and see denises pretty blond head bending over her fine sewing toni became so devoted to waiting on lucie that he grew positively inattentive to paul who was compelled to swear at toni once in a while and threaten to cuff him to bring him to his senses at new years pauls father and mother and captain and madame ravenel came to beaupre for a visit the little house could not accommodate more than two persons besides the master and mistress so monsieur and madame verney were entertained in great style at the chateau bernard by madame bernard toni had never been able to see madame ravenel without being reminded as paul had told him in their boyhood of a soft and solemn strain of music in a dim cathedral or of the river taking its way at twilight softly through the grassy meadow where the violets grew she was still sadshe never could be anything but thatbut her beautiful eyes had lost their troubled look and she seemed at peace captain ravenel was the same quiet silent soldierly man as always who was never far from madame ravenels side no woman was ever better loved and protected than poor sophie on this visit for the first time toni plucked up spirit enough to speak to madame ravenel she talked with him in her gentle voice about bienville and his life there and of denise and how she had been amused at watching them when they were little children together toni told madame ravenel how he dodged furtively around the corner of the acacia tree and climbed upon the garden wall to see her pass to and from church madame ravenel went to church as much as ever but now she went a little way within the church though never close up to the altar and captain ravenel maintained his old practice of escorting her to church and walking up and down in the street smoking his cigar until she came out when he escorted her home again and never let her be one waking moment without his protection since lucie had come into her american fortune the ravenels no longer found it necessary to practise that stern economy which had characterized the first years of their married life lucie made sophie accept an allowance small indeed compared with the fortune which delorme had squandered but it was enough to lift the ravenels above poverty the week that the ravenels and the verneys were at beaupre was a time of quiet happiness to everybody in the modest house in which lucie played at being poor madame bernard had of course declared at first that she could only see sophie and ravenel surreptitiously as it were but ended as she invariably did by driving up in her great coach and absolutely taking sophie to drive in the face of all beaupre this was lucies doing unaided by either of the persons concerned by paul or by captain ravenel but lucie was accustomed to triumphs of this sort and knew perfectly well how to achieve them one morning a year after pauls marriage when toni went to him at seven oclock in the morning he found paul already up and dressed and walking in the garden and he shouted as toni came in its a boy toni and that very day toni was taken up stairs into a darkened room where in a lace and silk covered bassinet lay the little paul who seemed to toni at once grotesque and sacred as indeed it seemed to paul himself the baby waxed and thrived and after a while when lucie and paul again had their breakfast in the garden as they had done in their early married life the baby was brought out and lay in his nurses arms blinking solemnly at the great wide world before him paul verney was a devoted father and as he had talked intimately with toni all his life so he talked with him about this child so longed for and so loved it seems to me toni said paul one morning after breakfast in the garden when lucie and the baby had gone within for their noonday rest and paul was looking over some papers which toni had brought him it seems to me toni as if i am too happy it makes me afraid a look of fear came into tonis eyes i feel the same way he whispered everything seems to be too easytoo bright now if the sergeant had kept on opposing me or if mademoiselle duval were against mebut i do assure you paul they are both as sweet as milk i dont know how long it will last but if it lasts until i marry denise that will be long enough my mother has just sold a little piece of ground she had on the outskirts of bienville and has got a thumping price for it i think the sergeant is more in love with her than ever since she sold the ground for such a price well toni answered paul gaily we dont deserve our happinessthat much is certain i am no more fit for lucie than you are fit for deniseshes a thousand times too good for you and always will bebut we can enjoy our happiness just the same another year passed and toni had come to believe that this earth was heaven and would have been most unwilling to leave it for the brightest prospects above denise was then very busy sewing at her wedding trousseau and toni would be pauls servant only a little while longer a corporal was toni to becomean honor that toni had no more dreamed of than of succeeding president loubet this honor was equally astonishing to sergeant duval but all the same toni was to be promoted and was not to ride in the ranks any longer this distinction he had not coveted as it implied a great deal more work even than he had to do as a private soldier but one must accept honors even when thrust upon one it made the prospect of the ridingschool seem less attractive to toni he not only began to feel that the separation from paul would be harder than ever but from lucie also and the little baby paul in some unaccountable way this little morsel of humanity had stolen his way into tonis heart so much so that when the baby preferred to play with jacques in preference to all the expensive toys which were lavished on him toni actually tied jacques around the babys neck and made a solemn gift of it to him it seemed almost incredible to toni that he could give jacques away but it was to him very like the bestowal of a splendid heirloom on a child who is to carry on the traditions of a great family as for the sergeant ever since madame marcel had sold her piece of ground he had treated toni as a son when toni was made a corporal he could command his own time much more than when he had been a private soldier but denise like most brides was so taken up with the important matter of the trousseau that she had very little time to bestow on toni toni never having questioned her authority in his life quietly submitted to this illustration a corporal was toni to become at last the great day drew nearit was only a week offthe day of tonis marriage toni expected to be frightened to death but paul warned him that if he showed the white feather he should have the longpromised cuffing as soon as he returned from his wedding tour the sergeant also suspected tonis courage and kept a stern eye on him in the last day or so before the wedding but toni maintained his courage and declared the only thing he dreaded was the march up the aisle of the church and back again in which apprehension he did not stand alone among bridegrooms although it was only the wedding of a corporal and the sergeants daughter it was to be quite a grand affair chiefly through the exertions of lucie who dearly loved to make a gala out of everything and particularly out of tonis and denises marriage she had bestowed presents on them with a lavish hand and paul out of his small pay and allowance had given toni a handsome gold watch the great question of the honeymoon and where it was to be spent came up being a corporal toni could get a short leavehow much he did not know the next day toni laid his case before paul when he and lucie were at breakfast in the garden the boy could now toddle about his dark bright eyes like his mothers he was fonder than ever of toni and liked to be carried on his strong arm toni was holding the baby thus and he was clutching jacques devotedly in his little hand lucie suggested a whole week but paul shook his head at the mention of a weeks leave for a corporal it would be very unusual he said lucie said nothing at all but when paul had gone off went up and taking the baby out of tonis arms and laying her soft cheek against little pauls roseleaf face said to toni i think i can manage it and she did in a manner precisely like lucie she dressed herself in her prettiest gown and hat took her white lace parasol and getting into a carriage went in search of the colonel of the regiment when she found him she poured out the story of toni and denise and all about bienville including her childish love affair with paul and then she went on and recounted with such inimitable drollery her efforts to wring an offer out of paul his horror at her american ways of doing things and the perplexity which a frenchman always experiences in his loveaffairs with an american that the colonel burst out laughing and agreed to do anything lucie should ask and what she asked was one whole week of leave for tonis honeymoon the colonel also promised to protect lucie from pauls wrath when he should hear how tonis leave had been obtained this was needed for paul scowled and growled that women should not meddle with such things to which lucie promptly agreed except when it should be some affair in which like this a woman was deeply interested mademoiselle duval hankered very much to go on the honeymoon with toni and denise but having heard that paris was a very sinful place she doubted the wisdom of trusting herself there even for a visit toni contrived to make her understand that paris was a great deal more sinful even than she suspected it to be that there were few churches and the means of salvation were limited and finally convinced mademoiselle duval that she would risk her souls salvation by venturing in that wicked town toni and denise had selected for their wedding day the anniversary of the marriage of paul and lucie two years before the wedding was as fine as lucie could make it and she had great capabilities in that line the garrison chapel was decked with flowers the organ played and it was much more like the wedding of a lieutenant than a corporallucie paying for it all madame marcel came from bienville to the wedding and was resplendent in a purple silk gown a lace collar and a bonnet with an aigrette in it she looked so young and handsome that together with the sale of her piece of land she wholly dazzled the sergeant who speculated on his chances of leading her to the altar sometime within a year mademoiselle duval treated herself to a new black gown and a very forbiddinglooking black bonnet but really presented an elegant though austere appearance denises white wedding gown was made with her own fingers and although it was only a simple muslin never was there a daintier looking bride in the world than the sergeants daughter in the first row of seats in the church sat paul and lucie the latter charmingly dressed in honor of the occasion the chapel was filled with humbler people friends of the bride and bridegroom the bride with her father the sergeant arrived in great state in lucies victoria and pair and the same equipagethe handsomest in beauprecarried the newlymarried pair back to the large room in one of the plain but comfortable hotels of the place where a wedding breakfast was served toni was not at all frightened at the imminent circumstances of the day on the contrary he felt a sense of protection in marrying denise she would always be at hand to take care of him for toni felt the need of being taken care of just as much in spite of his five feet ten and his one hundred and fifty pounds weight and his being the crack rider in the regiment as he had done in the old days at bienville when he ran away from the little clery boys he did not therefore experience the usual panic which often attacks the stoutesthearted bridegroom and went through the wedding breakfast with actual courage he absolutely forgot everything painful in his past life nicolas and pierre melted awayhe did not feel as if they had ever existed the secret which had haunted him was a mere fantasy that vanished in the glow of his wedding morning paul and lucie came in during the breakfast and paul proposed the bridegrooms health with his hand on tonis shoulder toni grinning in ecstasy meanwhile paul spoke of their early intimacy and toni made a very appropriate replyat least denise and madame marcel thought so after the lieutenant and his wife had left the fun grew fast and furious it was as merry a wedding breakfast as pauls and lucies even though the guests were such simple people as would come to the corporals wedding with the sergeants daughter toni could have said with truth that it was the happiest day of his life when the wedding party dispersed and they returned to the duvals lodgings that the bride might change her dress the sergeant being left alone in the little sittingroom with madame marcel grew positively tender saying to her in the manner which he had found perfectly killing with the girls twentyfive years before now madame that we have seen our children happily married we should think somewhat of our own future the same joy which those two children have may be ours madame marcel who had heretofore received all the sergeants gallant speeches with an air of blushing consciousness suddenly burst out laughing in a very selfpossessed manner and said oh we are much too old monsieur we should be quite ridiculous if either one of us thought of marrying the sergeant received a shock at this particularly as he considered himself still young and handsome my dear madame marcel he replied impressively certainly age has not touched you and i flatter myselfhere he drew himself up and twirled the ends of his superblywaxed mustachesthat so far time has not laid his hand heavily on me if you wish to marry monsieur replied madame marcel still laughing you ought to marry some young girl men of your age always like girls young enough to be their daughters and she laughed again quite impertinently the sergeant frowned at madame marcel he had never seen this phase of her character before i assure you madame he said stiffly that if i care to aspire to the hand of a young woman of my daughters age i might not be really considered too old but i prefer a maturer person like yourself madame marcel seeing that the sergeant was becoming deeply chagrined determined not to dash his hopes too suddenly so she reassumed her old manner of girlish embarrassment and said well monsieur one wedding makes many you know but a wedding is a fatiguing business to go through with particularly at our age it will take us both at our time of life several weeks to recover from this delightful event and we may then discuss the project you mention this was slightly encouraging and as the sergeant had nothing better to comfort himself with he contrived to extract some satisfaction from it when denise appeared dressed in her neat gray traveling gown the verneys handsome victoria was at the door to take her and toni to the station toni and denise felt very grand as well as very happy sitting up in the fine victoria with the pair of prancing bays and although they were conscious that the footman and coachman were thrusting their tongues into their cheeks it mattered very little to denise and toni whose black eyes were lustrous with delight at last he reflected joyously he had some one who would be obliged to look after him the rest of his life when they reached the station the train was almost ready to depart toni had wished on this auspicious day to travel to paris secondclass but the prudent denise concluded that as they would go through life thirdclass they had better begin on that basis so toni selected a thirdclass carriage which was vacant and tipping half a franc to the guard he and denise found themselves in it without other company it was their first moment alone since they had been made one toni put his arm around denise and drew her head on his shoulder with the strangest feeling in his heart of being protected and denise for her part had the sense of having adopted this fine handsome laughing fellow to shield under her wing the rest of her life yet they were lovers deep and sincere no french gentleman had ever treated his fiancee with greater respect than toni the corporal had treated denise or ever had a higher rapture in their first long kiss he was roused from his dream in paradise by the consciousness of a sinister presence near him and his eyes fell on the red head of nicolas peering like the serpent in the garden of eden in at the window of the railway carriage if the place of eternal torment had yawned before tonis eyes he could not have felt a greater horror and this was increased when nicolas coolly opened the door of the carriage and got in followed by pierre and the two seated themselves directly opposite the newlymarried pair almost immediately the train moved off toni had only one thought in his mindto keep denise from finding out that terrible secret of hiswhy he hated and feared these men he hated and feared them now more than ever but some new courage seemed to be born in him the cardinal difference between a brave man and a coward is that a brave man can think when he is afraid and can even act sensibly and a coward can not do either always before this when he had been frightened toni had acted like a fool but now he acted as sensibly as paul verney himself could and for once behaved bravely although he was contending with men instead of horses the two rogues opposite him leered at denise nudged each other and pierre held out his hand to toni illustration seated themselves directly opposite the newly married pair how do you do comrade he said for answer toni folded his arms and looked at the extended paw with disgust no i thank you he replied in a voice as steady as if he were managing a vicious brute of a horse denise dont look at them my dear and he motioned her to sit with him in the furthest corner of the carriage denise surmised who these two individuals were but said nothing only averting her eyes from them nicolas then persisted in trying to converse we are back from algiers he remarked impressively it doesnt require a genius to know that toni answered tartly its a great pity you were not kept there for ever he felt astonished at his own boldness in saying this and the devil of fear taking on a new guise made him afraid of his own boldness but at all events he felt that there was no danger of his betraying himself then before denise nicolas and pierre continued to wink and make remarks evidently directed at denise toni stood it quietly but the first time the guard passed he spoke to him these two fellows he said are impertinent to my wife at the first station i would thank you to put them in another carriage the guard had seen the fine style in which toni had driven to the station with his bride and also respected tonis smart corporals uniform so he bowed politely and said certainly and the next station being reached in two minutes toni had the satisfaction of seeing his two friends unceremoniously hauled out and thrust into another carriage which was before nearly full as they went out pierre laugheda laugh terrible in tonis ears you havent been very polite to us he said but we shall meet again remember i promised you that when we parted two years ago and we never go back on what we say this troubled denise and when they were alone toni told her as much as he thought well for her to know of nicolas and pierre but it was not enough to disturb her very much on her wedding journey toni however again felt that old fear clutching and tearing him his courage had been merely outward and outward it continued he was apparently the most smiling and cheerful bridegroom in the whole city of paris but no man ever carried on his heart a heavier load of anxiety and oppression madame marcel had given toni a little sum of money which was quite beyond his corporals pay for his wedding tour and they had taken a little lodging in the humbler quarters of paris and here they were to spend the precious week of their honeymoon it was still bright daylight at seven on a june evening when they reached their lodgings and removed the stains of travel toni in the gayest manner possible proposed that they should take a stroll on the river bank before going to their supper it was a heavenly evening and a gorgeous sunset was mirrored in the dancing river as toni and denise leaned over the parapet of the bridge of the invalides holding each others hands as they had done when they were little children sitting on the bench under the acacia tree at bienville toni could have groaned aloud in his agony he would be the happiest creature on earth if only those two wretches had not appeared he was happy in spite of them but then the terrible thought came to him that they had promised to kill him and paul verney too and they were of a class of men who usually keep their word when they promise villainy he felt an acute pang of sorrow for denise and an acute pang for himself and for paul and lucieso young they all were so happy and that happiness threatened by a couple of wretches who would think no more of taking a mans life than of killing a rat if they had the opportunity he looked at the crowds of gailydressed people which filled the streets with life he looked at denise in the charming freshness of her youth her tender eyes repeating with every glance that she loved toni better than anybody else in the world he considered all the splendor and beauty around himthe dancing river and the great arched dark blue sky above them in which the palpitating stars were shining faintly and a silver moon trembledand he could scarcely keep from groaning aloud at the thought of being torn from all he loved but he gave no outward sign of it denise thought him as happy as she was after their supper at a gay cafe they came across one of those openair balls which are a feature of paris and they danced together merrily for an hour everybody saw they were sweethearts and some jokes were made at their expense which toni did not mind in the least and would have enjoyed hugely butbut afterward they walked home under the quiet night sky in place of their gaiety and laughter a deep and solemn happiness possessed toni as well as denise except for this terrible fear black and threatening which would not be thrust out of his happiest hours paris in june for a pair of lovers on a honeymoon trip with enough money to meet their modest wants is an earthly paradise denise loved to exhibit her muslin gowns made with her own hands by the side of her handsome corporal in the cheap cafes and theaters which they patronized they found acquaintances as everybody does in paris the lodginghouse keeper became their friend and invited them to her daughters birthday fete they went out to versailles on sunday and saw the fountains plashing studied the windows of the magnificent shops in the grand avenues and were perfectly happy except for the black care that sat upon tonis heart life could be so delightful thought toni but his would end so soon toni almost felt the knife that nicolas would stick into him he pondered over the various ways in which he might be killeda blow like that which felled count delorme might do for him he imagined himself found dead in the streets of beaupre some dark night and the story of how he came by his death would never be known and he thought of paulthat his body might be found in a thicket of the park of the chateau bernard just as count delormes had been toni was an imaginative person and the horror of his situation was enhanced by the paradise of the present he wondered sometimes how he managed to keep it all from denise but he did for once too soon the time came when he had to return to beaupre it was on a wet and gloomy day that he and denise alighted from a thirdclass carriage at the little station they walked straight to their modest lodgings and then toni went to seek paul his leave was not up by several hours so he need not report at once he found paul at the headquarters building in a little room where he worked alone when toni came in and shut the door carefully behind him paul whirled around in his chair expecting to see a radiant rapturous toni instead of that toni dropped the mask which he had worn before denise and looked at paul with a pair of eyes so distressed so haunted so anxious that paul knew in a moment something had happened well toni he began and then asked what is the matter toni instead of standing at attention leaned heavily against the deskhis legs could hardly support him the day i was married he said when denise and i got in the railway carriage to go to paris nicolas and pierre got in too pauls ruddy frank and smiling face grew pale as toni said these words they might mean for him as well as for toni a decree of doom and like toni he was so happy that the thought he should be torn away from it all seemed the more cruel and what did they say and do he inquired after a painful pause they were very insulting at first to denise but i told her not to notice them and they wanted to shake hands with me but i refused did you cried paul in amazement is it possible that you didnt act like a poltroon and shake hands with them and do whatever they asked you to do this was no sarcasm on pauls part but a plain expression of what he expected toni would do and toni was not at all offended at this imputation on his courage and good sense yes he said i acted the man with them i never did it before but i did more than thati called the guard who made them go into another carriage paul gazed at toni with wideeyed surprise here was the most astonishing thing that ever happenedtoni actually showing a little courage with these men i can hardly believe it is you toni standing before me if you had shown the same spirit all the time you would not now live in dread about that delorme affair perhaps not sighed poor toni but you know how i always was paul i think you are going to be something different now replied paul cheerfully it was not pleasantthe thought that these two rascals who had promised to kill him as well as toni were alive and in paris but pauls nerves were perfect and he easily recovered his balance but the thought of itthe thought of it cried toni opening his arms and standing up straight the knife entering my breast or that blow on the side of the head such as they gave count delorme i feel them and see them everywhere i look if i see a man walking on the street he seems to take the shape of nicolas or pierre every time i turn a corner i expect to see them and there is deniseand then i think of you being found some night or some day deadwill it be in the morning or in the eveningwill it be in the summer time or in the autumnand madame and the little one falling into a chair toni broke down and cried and sobbed bitterly paul put his arm around tonis neck their two heads were close together just as they had been in the old days on the bridge at bienville he said no word to toni but the touch of his arm was strength and comfort and presently toni stopped crying and grew calm again never mind toni said paul i think we can take care of ourselves we must go armed it would not do any good if you were to inform on those two rascals of course they would deny ityou cant punish a man for crime he hasnt committed we shall have to take our chancesthat is all but if one of us is killed the other one will be safe because then your story will be believed that was not much comfort to toni who replied if you are killed what will life be to me and if i am killed think of denise and you they sat a little while longer talking paul encouraging toni and at last raising in him some of the spirit which had made him have nicolas and pierre turned out of the railway carriage paul said that they were comparatively safe at beaupre where nicolas and pierre would not dare to come but toni did not take this view he thought that men who had committed one murder and had contemplated another for two years would not hesitate to come to beaupre in order to fulfil their purpose the effort to keep his agony from being suspected by denise was however perfectly successful denise suspected nothing nor did the sergeant nor anybody except paul verney baby pauls birthday was celebrated a few days after toni and denise returned and there was a little fete to which they were invited it was given on the terrace of the chateau bernard where paul and lucies wedding breakfast had been served the baby a beautiful child toddling about clung to jacques which hung around his neck by a little gold chain with as much tenacity as toni had clasped that gallant soldier for so many years of his boyhood also the little boy clung to toni and refusing to go to his nurse insisted on being carried in tonis arms the whole afternoon this pleased toni immensely and amused everybody present lucie looked charming as ever and thanked toni for playing nursemaid the childs beauty and the delight of the young father and mother in him almost broke tonis heart in a little while the boy might be fatherless and that gay and graceful lucie might be widowed he was still haunted by that vision of the face of nicolas whom he reckoned if there be such a thing as a gradation in villainy to be a worse villain than pierre that is to say a more dangerous one he glanced around him fearfully expecting to see one or the other of them at last while walking about the grounds below the terrace still carrying the little paul in his short fluffy white dress there was something like a horrible passing vision of nicolas red head behind the hedge that divided the gardens from the park at that moment lucie followed by the nurse appeared tripping through the grass her pretty black head was bare and she held up her dainty chiffon skirts showing beautiful black satin shoes with shining buckles on them i came to look for you toni she cried you must enjoy yourself this afternoon and not be troubled with little paul all the time he must be made to go to his nurse and behave himself it is no trouble madame said toni from the very bottom of his heart i love to have the little fellow in my arms and he is so quiet and good when he is with me come dearest said lucie to the baby nurse will take youat which little paul was neither good nor quiet but kicked and screamed and would have nothing to say to the nurse much to the indignation of the latter who accused toni of spoiling the child outrageously glancing around at that moment toni distinctly saw nicolas head behind the hedge not only he saw it but lucie as well she walked toward the opening through which the path ran and as she saw nicolas very dusty and travelstained her generous heart went out in pity to him she was always taking in stray cats and dogs and stray human beings as well and giving them a dinner and a franc and on this day above all others no one near her should want for anything she went up to nicolas and asked pleasantly whom are you looking for my man nicolas in no wise taken aback replied politely for an old comrade of minetoni by name he did not recognize lucie but seeing something in her manner of address which indicated that he might get money out of her he whined i have been serving my time in africa and got back to france very poor and i have hardly had a good meal since i came you shall not say that cried lucie no person and certainly no one who has been a soldier shall want for a meal where we are come she turned and walked toward the chateau the nurse meanwhile wrestling vigorously with the baby whom toni secretly encouraged in his rebellion nicolas followed lucie and was delighted at his own diplomacy he reckoned her good for a couple of francs at least she showed him a side entrance where in a small and shady courtyard the servants were drinking little pauls health and cutting a birthday cake expressly designed for them nicolas went in and not only ate and drank in honor of the little child whose father he meant to murder but was provided with a good meal by lucies orders after he had eaten and drunk he desired to slink away not thinking it worth while to risk meeting paul even in the pursuit of the couple of francs which he felt sure he could get out of lucie as he slouched rapidly across the lawn he looked up and saw on the terrace paul and lucie standing together all the guests had left and madame bernard had gone indoors but toni meaning to give paul a word of warning remained a little while with denise waiting for his chance to speak but his warning was not necessary as lucie saw nicolas shabby figure slinking across the lawn she said to paul there is a man that i found outside the hedge and he has been a soldier so i made him come in and he drank the babys health with the servants and i made them give him a good meal besides a glance of recognition which neither lucie nor denise saw passed between paul and toni paul only remarked to her you should be a little careful lucie in introducing strange men among the servants even though they claim to be soldiers however no harm is done this time but he said he was hungry paul and i can not bear that any one at the chateau bernard or at our house should want for anything on this delightful daythe babys first birthday as lucie spoke her eyes sparkled and she laid her hand on pauls shoulder their honeymoon had as yet no break toni then turned to go with denise he maintained his outward calm though inwardly he was stormtossed he knew that paul verney suffered none of these qualms of terror but was perfectly cool calm and selfpossessed oh what a thing is courage thought toni to be a brave man all around but he was learning to master his fear a little or at least to control the outward expression of it he and denise walked briskly through the park denise it being still their honeymoon would have liked to loiter a little in the twilight shadows but toni making the excuse that he would soon be due at the barracks they lost no time he took denises hand in his she thought it was a lovers clasp but in truth he felt that old clinging to denise for protection as well as affection he wished that he could have put his hand in his pocket and felt jacques but jacques was now the treasured possession of the little paul toni was glad when he got out of the park and into the lighted streets he had to go to the barracks and denise was to return to their lodgings they parted under a dark archway and had the opportunity to exchange a farewell kiss toni wondered if it would be the last kiss he would ever give denise for the first time denise looking into tonis troubled eyes began to suspect something was wrong with him but she said no word and went quietly home it was then nearly eight oclock and toni was kept busy at the barracks for an hour more he was off duty that night and was allowed to spend it at home and at ten oclock he left the big barrack yard to go to his lodgings the afternoon and early evening had been brilliantly lovely but now a cold rain was fitfully falling and the night sky was dark with stormclouds which raced across the face of the moon the streets of the little town grew deserted and toni as he walked rapidly along saw nicolas and pierre in imagination behind every wall and tree and corner there was a short way to his lodgings which led through the narrow and dark streets but the long way led by the railway station where there were always people moving about and a plenty of light and toni concluded to take the long way home he ran nearly all the way longing to get to the circle of light made by the railway station there was one place where he had to cross a bridge which spanned the iron tracks and it was quite dark toni felt his heart thumping and jumping as he neared this place once across it he would feel comparatively safe and would walk along quietly in the glare of the electric lamps as he got to this place he heard a smothered cry and frightened as he was he stopped and peered over the rail of the bridge near the track two figures were wrestling desperately in the halfdarkness toni could see that each one was trying to throw the other on the railway track faroff sounded the roar and reverberation the thunder and shaking of the earth of the fastapproaching express train toni was thrilled with horror and frozen to the ground he could not have moved to have saved his life in fact there was no way for him to reach the two men struggling to destroy each other except by leaping over the bridge twenty feet below the huge headlight of the onrushing train cast a ghastly glare over the black earth intersected by lines of steel and revealed to toni that the two figures in mortal struggle were nicolas and pierre nicolas was the stronger of the two and he was trying to throw pierre under the wheels of the advancing locomotive but pierre hung on with unnatural strength he could not drag himself away from the track but he clung fiercely and desperately to nicolas in an instant more the train thundered upon the two men and wild shrieks cut the air above the roar the locomotive gave a sudden jar and then plunged ahead and came to a stop toni holding on with both hands to the parapet of the bridge could have cried aloud in fear and horror of what was passing before him a dozen figures of men with flashing lanterns appeared at once and by the side of the track they picked up pierre and nicolas where they had been pitched both of them were quite dead illustration he stopped and peered over the rail of the bridge all of tonis faculties had seemed numbed while he had watched this tragedy of less than five minutes duration but in the space of a second the instinct of flight developed in him and he turned around and ran retracing his path as if a thousand devils were after him his heart was thumping still more wildly than when he had followed the same road a little while before but now it was for joy toni was a primitive creature and was not troubled by any scruples in rejoicing at the death of his fellow man when that fellow man had worried and troubled him as pierre and nicolas had done he kept on thanking god in his heart and even whispering his thanks as he ran he took the short way back to his lodgings in the same street only a few doors off was a small church the lights in most of the houses were out all was quietthe church and houses as well as the people seemed asleep tonis pious instincts rose up and possessed him he must go into that church and thank god for himself for denise for paul and for lucie he crept up the steps and quietly tried the door but it was locked toni had a jackknife in his pocket and the lock on the church door not being worth much he deliberately pried it open and stepped softly into the church it was dark and damp and the flagstones were very cold but faroff before the little altar the sanctuary lamp glowed brightly a sudden remembrance overcame toni of madame ravenel not daring to go far in the church and he honestly reckoned himself a much worse person than madame ravenel so he fell down on the cold stones of the aisle just within the door not on his knees but on his face and thanked god and all the saints that pierre and nicolas were dead he recalled with an agony of remorse that when he was a boy he used to run away on sundays instead of going to church and felt himself the chief of sinners because he had not listened with the strictest attention and the deepest satisfaction to longwinded sermons he began to sob and pray aloud in his ecstasy of gratitude and promised more things to the most high than the greatest saint that ever lived could have performed he repeated every prayer he knew but as his repertory was not extensive he had to say them over again many times the stones were hard and cold as most stones are but toni thought them a bed of roses he did not know how long he had lain there but presently sheer fatigue brought him to his senses it occurred to him that denise might be anxious about him but he was in that exaltation of piety which made him rather exult in being uncomfortable himself and making denise uncomfortable tooa not uncommon condition in natures like tonis he had been there more than an hour when he heard a light step behind him and turned there was denise with her hat and jacket on she tiptoed up to him and whispered in his ear i went out in the street to look for you toni and i saw the church door open and you lying here what are you doing thanking god responded toni out loud down on your knees denise denise very much astounded at this newlydeveloped piety of tonis did as she was bid having been piously brought up at the end of a few minutes she rose but toni was obstinate he wanted to stay in the church all night on his knees denise determined to find out what ailed him spoke to him with that tone of gentle authority which he had never resisted since they were little children together walking hand in hand at bienville she dragged toni out of the church stumbling along in the darkness and he shut the door carefully they were only a step or two from their lodgings and climbing up to their two little rooms toni took denise in his arms and poured out the whole story of nicolas and pierre sobbing between times and laughing like one possessed denise weptshe saw nothing to laugh atand actually expressed some pity for the two lost souls of nicolas and pierre this seemed really impious to toni the recital did not take long and then toni taking his cap said i must run now as fast as i can to the chateau bernard monsieur paul must know this denise did not detain him and he ran softly down stairs and took his way through the dark streets and along the deserted highway until he reached the park of the chateau bernard he climbed the wall and walked swiftly through the park until he got to the chateau standing white and stately upon its broad terraces it was then quite one oclock in the morning the sky had cleared and a great hobgoblin moon was looking down on the church steeples of the town visible afar off toni knew the window of pauls room it was on the first floor above the ground floor and at a corner he knew the only way to awaken paul without alarming the house was to throw pebbles at his window but there were no pebbles to be found he remembered however that paul was a light sleeper and going under the window toni called out softly a dozen timespaulpaulmonsieur presently the window of the room came open and he heard pauls voice asking softly who is that it is i whispered toni creeping under the window come down in a few moments a small door under the window opened noiselessly and paul came out in his trousers and shirt toni caught him around the neck and whispered in his ear they are dead paul both of them they were fighting on the railway track when the paris train came along i saw them both quite dead paul knew at once whom toni meant a great wave of gratitude welled up in his heart he did not like toni drop on his face and weep and fall into a paroxysm of piety but he felt his release from the sentence of death pronounced against them both as much as toni did then we are saved toni from that knifethrust in the heart or that blow on the side of the head said paul quietly thank god i have told denise whispered toni now you go paul and tell madame just then a light shone in lucies window she passed into pauls room and going to the open window her white figure leaned out i am coming in now dearest called paul softly stepping under the window i have good news in a little while toni was plodding back through the park he meant to be a model husband the best father that ever lived if god should give him children the most worthy blameless corporal in the french army he meant to give all his substance to the poor including denises dowry to go to church twice a day on weekdays and three times on sundays and to lead a life which would be a perfect combination of the contemplative and the actively charitable all of the time that he could spare from his military duties he meant to give to prayer and to make denise pray with him he intended to fast and to make denise fast too not st elizabeth queen of hungary married to st louis king of france could have led the life which toni in these first moments promised that he and denise should lead never was there on earth so good a man as toni meant to be
