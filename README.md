# NLP Project on PoS Tagging
In this project we aim to apply parts-of-speech tagging on two texts. For this purpose, we will first have to apply preprocessing such as removing runnung words & stop words, minimise all upper case letters, tokenise all the words, etc. We will also be doing analysis and visualization on the texts to get a better understanding and draw inferences. <br>
The texts we will be using are The Kingmakers, by Burton E. Stevenson and The Return of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

# Usage Instructions
There are two jupyter notebooks corresponding to the two texts used. <br>
`book1.ipynb` is for The Kingmakers, by Burton E. Stevenson <br>
`book2.ipynb` is for The Return of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle <br>
Run the corresponding notebook for the required text.
